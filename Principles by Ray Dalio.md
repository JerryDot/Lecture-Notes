Principles by Ray Dalio
 
Introduction - sets up the reader to approach the rest of the book in a state of mind hopefully conducive to its understanding. Prompts the reader to ask themself *"Is it true?"* when understanding each principle.
 
## Part 1: The Importance of Principles
 
My answers to the 5 questions (before reading Ray's answers):
 
What are principles?
 
General rules used to guide an individual/collective's actions. In some sense they might be consider axioms when related to moral "should" questions but more often are tools to inform "how to act" in new situations based on experience of old. They should therefore be responsive to updates.
 
Ray - they are the link between values and actions and a guide in dealing with the laws of reality. They are turned to when facing hard decisions
 
Why are principles important?
 
The world is too complicated to do a complete analysis of almost any situation. Humans must make simplifications that allow them to function adequately in the real world. Principles are a form of mapping complex situations into simpler ones allowing for more time-efficient behaviour (even if it involves sacrificing some correctness/optimisation)
 
Ray - It is inefficient to operate without principles and even worse for companies as otherwise employees with behave inconsistently with each other.
 
Where do principles come from?
 
Experience, learning, derivation, science, reflection. Ultimately for a rational being then you would expect principles to develop in each individual over time in a strictly positive direction but this is unlikely given that a lot of human thought does not go through an appropriate backpropagation channel.
 
Ray - need to reflect values that you really believe in but apart from that they can come from many different places
 
Do you have principles that you live your life by? What are they?
 
I'd answer this question fully in private but not in public right now - despite this being against the spirit of Dalio's principles about Trust in Truth.
 
Ray - they are important for guiding your relationships with others.
 
How well do you think they will work, and why?
 
Most limitations here are going to be related to the human condition. I'm somewhat sceptical but also inexperienced.
 
Ray - important to view them in context with your values and given the choices available
 
## Part 2 - Ray's Most Fundamental Life Principles
 
Truth is important and particular when related to encountering and dealing with mistakes/problems/flaws. An accurate understanding of reality is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.
 
Then follows some WEIRD morality stuff but there is useful emphasis on the importance for self-evolution ie learn to learn etc.
 
* React to pain well. Pre-frontal cortex vs amygdala. Pain + Reflection = Progress
 
* Face harsh realities and ask yourself "Is it true?" because knowing what is true is _good_.
 
* Worry about achieving goal rather than looking good doing so. This means that you should seek to learn more and be keen to find out your weaknesses
 
* Care about second and higher order consequences as well as future costs (basically don't make myopic decisions time-wise)
