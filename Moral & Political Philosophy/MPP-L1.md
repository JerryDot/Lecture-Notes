# Morality: objective or subjective?

## A. Meta-ethics

We (the lecture audience) have a wide range of moral/ethical judgements and assessments. Things can be "good", people are "decent" or "trustworthy". Actions can be "right", "supererogatory" etc. (supererogatory means beyond the call of duty - good but not required)

Normative ethics is first-order theorising that seeks to understand in more general terms which states of affair are morally desirable and which actions are right or permissible. It is an abstraction from specific judgements to generalised judgement-creating frameworks

Meta-ethics is the theory about the nature and status of ethics (so can be considered a second-order theory compared to ethics). Asks questions like "what are we saying"
