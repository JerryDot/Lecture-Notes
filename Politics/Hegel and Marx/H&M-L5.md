Marx on the state and politics. Typically embedded in events of the time - so can be hard to understand without the historical context. Rarely steps back for general theoretical accounts. Secondary sources do try to address this though. They enable us to see an overarching narrative. Marx more understandable when writing for an American audience.

This is a very broad subject and applies to the state under capitalism, under communism and most of the time. Seems like Marx wanted to give the state more independence from the will of the ruling class. Initial attempts to model the state seemed to fail as examples showed.

The state in capitalist society - not the capitalist state. Frames it in a more general way - we should not presuppose the latter.

# State in Capitalist Society
Elster's three models:

## Instrumental model

Most well-known (but likely abandoned by Marx at some point) is the **instrumental model**/account. The state is simply a tool of the economically dominant class. State has little or no autonomy under this account - it is subservient. The state is controlled by the capitalist class and only acts to protect the long-term interests of the bourgeoisie as a whole.

The state here acts against the proletariat but the state might in certain circumstances act against some of the bourgeoisie (in the interests of the rest of the bourgeoisie). Eg penalties against unionisation etc. The bourgeoisie might be checked from short-term over-exploitation of the proletariat if it leads to instability. This would be the state focussing on the long-term interests. Might try to stop cartels/monopolies.

There is evidence after 1850 he larges abandons this view or at least an element of the view (could claim it is not directly controlled by the capitalist class but does still serve the bourgeoisie). Abandoned because the state did not seem to act in the way that this model predicted

## Class balance model

In exceptional circumstances (where proletariat and bourgeoisie are finely balanced), the state can have a certain independence and pursue its own interests. State is an agent competing with the dominant class. Example of France - fine balance between prol/bour. Marx said that Napolitarianism was the only option at the time as alternatives would have collapsed.

Independent role might result in actions that protect each class against the other. "Exploits" the conflict of the classes to gain the power to address "its own" interests. Can still seem like the state is always acting for the bourgeoisie but we have added another restriction to what the state can do. So this is like a developed version of the instrumental model.

## "Abdication" model
The creation of the model reflects changing historical circumstances - does not think that there are non-exceptional circumstances as it is now stable development that is sufficiently transformative.

The bourgeoisie stay away from the direct exercise of political power _because_ it is in their interests to do so ("in order to save its purse, it must forfeit the crown"). The benefits here explain the abstention. Is this another extension of the class balance model?

Designed to cover two cases where the bourgeoisie avoid power. They withdraw from the power they had (eg in France) but also abstain from gaining political power (England and Germany). They share the same claim - capitalist class do so because it benefits their interests. Some evidence that Marx had toyed with this model earlier but had rejected it. Marx criticised Sterner for seeming to have this idea (as having no examples). But Marx himself had examples from 1850.

In England the abdication was to allow the aristocracy to continue to have its role in governing. Therefore it acts in the bourgeois interests without their direct involvement.

Much harder for the proletariat to organise/focus their influence. They have two targets and this reduces the chance of instability or a single well-defined conflict between rich and poor.

## Autonomy of the state
Weaker definition - the state is autonomous where it is independent of direct control (shown in both class balance and abdication models). But this seems too weak for the abdication model - the ruling class only has autonomy at the whim of the dominant class

Stronger definition - state structure and policies are not explained by the interests of the economically dominant class. This is only met by the temporary class balance model. Does this suggest that the optimal way for a state to function is for the two sides to be blatant and in balance? Should there be new revisions/models to explain how the state acts

# State under communism (the fate of the post-revolutionary polity)
This half is much more speculative than the capitalist section. Marx is reluctant to say what a Communist society will look like. Therefore is views are much harder to reconstruct. Are the political arrangements of communism sufficiently state-like for it to be referred to as such? (That is why the title in brackets might be used to avoid the terminology of "state").

Often the idea props up that Communism might exist of two stages. Transitional stage based on the "Contribution principle" when the institutions are still strongly marked by capitalist context. Later stage where the capitalist state left further behind - more based on the "Needs principle". Thought both stages would be lengthy historical epochs.

These are preceded by the "dictatorship of the proletariat" - which does not equal the first of the two communist stages (simply the revolution that marks the start of change). This is a democratic, extra-legal, temporary phase. No suggestion the Marx thought it would be anything other than passing - should not be afraid of the word "dictatorship" in this historical context.

The two stages are normally distinguished in terms of their economic conditions (and their distributive principles) - Contribution and Needs. Contribution - what we all get back from the social pot reflects in part what we put into it. Later this would be broken/amended by the Needs - what each gets from the social pot reflects more what they need. Reflections on the Paris Commune a good focal point of Marx's writings to see his analysis. He was sympathetic to the commune not due to its social innovations but because its political form anticipated the political forms of communism. State can be viewed as organised coersion and separate from the people. Marx felt that both of these aspects wane in communism.

Initially there still may be a need for organised coercive force but might become no longer necessary over time. The parasitic state would be remedied by the "radical deprofessionalisation of public life" (Hunt). Standing army replaced by national guard of citizens. Decisions carried out by elected polities responsible directly to citizens etc. Public functions would not be possessions or tools of central government.

Can we try to create a theory that analyses the proportion of production that is "useful"?

Coercion in communist society - can we imagine a polity in which there is no coercion? Do we have to assume that the polity is marked by complete and universal harmony between individuals to get this? Lecturer does not want to argue for its plausibility but may be explained in a reasonable way for Marx to have held. The implausible account is that there would be complete harmony. But there is little or no evidence for this. Challenge is to come up with an alternative explanation why coercion might reduce without this. We bump up the idea of democratic commitment and takes ideas from Marx's view of the commune. By emphasising participation etc maybe we can get closer to no coercion. IE the democratic commitment shapes the decision-makers to act majoritarianly. This seems like democratic coersion? But is a feasible way to proceed.
