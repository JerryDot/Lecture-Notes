Now we turn to Karl Marx. Why should we be interested in Marx? (defensive way of introducing the topic). Because of his historical influence? (That his work played a part in the emergence of the soviet union). This never seemed a particularly good reason to learn as a political theorist though. His influence here was highly indirect.

Shouldn't read Locke because he had a contested affect on the American revolution. It is because they have interesting, relevant and thought-provoking ways of thinking for us.

These are the topics Marx contributed towards:

* Theory of history

* Account of succeedings and failings of capitalism

* Political anthropology

* Vision of socialism

Lenin viewed Marx as a block of steel. M's writing are not as complete a system or as impervious to criticism as that though! They do not fulfil a theoretical unity. These lectures will not follow the basic headings except for the first in the list.

# Theory of History

Sometimes called historical materialism. Theory can be thought about in 4 chunks. Basic account in non-technical way, then try to link it with some technical elaboration, then parts of the theory that require some elaboration, then some kinds of criticism of the theory.

## Basic Vision
Some summary accounts:

"a society marches on its stomach and its stomach greatly influences the brain" - George Bernard Shaw. Might want a little more detail though

Does think that the history of humankind across the enourmous diversity of uman activities across time and countries - some kind of overaching story can be told. This idea can be used to get some projection of the future of history's cause. Marked by the growth of human productive capacity. 

We depend on the physical world for our survival but the world begins with stingy scarcity that must be overcome with the expenditure of ingenuity and effort. In this effort the world and societies were transformed. There is growth in human productive power. Once this grows it continues to improve which represents the overaching story/narrative.

Takes a particular form - these developments always take place in certain places in society. The growth is realising a succession of forms of society - ones that are resolved around a distinct economics structure. Eg feudalism and capitalism are different economic forms of society. These constitute economic epochs historically (and futurely?). The relationship between these discrete forms of society is important.

On Marx's account these stages rise or fall according to whether they facilitate or frustrate the growth of humankind. Eventually there is a limit to each structure's ability to facilitate. When this switches to a frustration then there is pressure for a new form of society.

"history is, fundamentally, the growth of human productive power ..." G A Cohen

## Theoretical elaboration
Connect this basic account with some more theory.

Preface to Contribution ... important bit of writing

Most of the terminology that Marx uses doesn't appear in the previous sketch of the theory 1859 preface

Three main entities:
* Forces of production - abilities and devices that are used in the process of production. Means of production + labour power. Maybe these have an objective bit and a subjective bit (the labour power). Some evidence that he considered the subjective bit more important (or at least that it would be after a certain level of production). Imagine you want to turn a productive society into a backward society. In some way it would be more effective to destroy the subjective element - if you could get people to forget how to forge steel then this would be more of a problem than destroying all the steel machinery.
* Relations of production - relations of economic power over the forces of production. The power that people do or don't have over productive forces (eg the means of production). You would have to map all groups and their individual relations between each element. Eg media producers and the subjective bit's relation to labour power. Individuals in some sense have complete power over their label power or some power or no power. THe conceptual possibilities might map onto historical real world situations. Eg people today vs serfs in the feudal system vs ancient slaves. In any given society it is the set of relations that constitute the economic structure (and identify different forms of society)
* Base + superstructure - economic structure and some legal and political institutions. This is maybe the more controversial bit. Marx regarded the characterisation between political and economical life as partly an architectural mechanism. Described as legal and political - Marx is referring to some institutions eg property law would definitely fall under this. The controversial bit isn't in including some institutions - the controversial bit (academically) is not trying to put loads of extra stuff in as well. Base = economic structure (this puts forces in the base). Gets us away a bit from considering the base and superstructure as purely exclusive. There is going to be some overlap or bleed.

More interesting are the kinds of theoretical claims that Marx tries to make about these entities

## Some theoretical claims

"Development thesis" - the "productive forces tend to develop throughout history". Refers to Marx's history of human productive power. Sees societies of capable of ever increasing and advanced production. Possible to think of this in  a weak or strong form. Marx was attached to the strong form. Difference is that in the weak version: where and whenever there is an increase in productivity - those gains tend to stick (societies learn from and circulate those productive accomplishments). Stronger version: each of these different forms of society has an internal tendency to increase productivity (combined with the weak version).

//Memory in human development as societal as well as individual//

"First primacy thesis" - "the level of development of productive power explains the nature of the economic structure". A relationship between the productive forces and the relations of production. Marx often said that they correspond. Nothing too problematic with "corresponds"

"Second primary thesis" - the economic structure of society explains the nature of its legal and political superstructure. 

## Some explanation for these claims

Cohen suggests that when we reconstruct Marx's argument we should look to make a functional explanation. This is to some degree necessary. M doesn't necessarily propound functional explanations. But what Mrx claims would put a lot of bounds on the types of explanations that would fit the theses. A functional explanation is the best way to explain the theses M made. 

Famous example from evolutionary biology:

Birds have hollow bones because hollow bones promote the ability to fly. Claims that the hollow bones are explained by their ability to fly. Functional explanation here does not violate the causal definition. Acceptable form of explanation. Cohen suggests something similar can be used the case of Marxism (according to Cohen)

The relations of production control the development of the forces of production as well according to Marx. This ties the forces and relations of production together. The prevailing relations of production prevail precisely because they promote the forces of production. Therefore the impact of relations on the forces does not embarrass the theory. Same kind of patterns are present in the second primacy thesis. Eg superstructure stabilises the basis. Both explained by the economic base and has an effect on the economic base.

What confers the economic power over a factory in capitalism. To some extent looks like it is enforced by the state. Doesn't this undermine the claim of "Base and superstructure". Only appears to do this. On a funcitonal account we can talk about capitalists only enjoy these rights because the state enforces it because it empowers the forces/relations of production. Legal structures rise or fall based on whether they sustain or frustrate the economic structure.

## Some elaboratory questions

What are the "epochs marking progress in the historical development of society"? Capitalism; feudalism; ancient; Asiatic (pre-classical) 1859 Preface. Last two levels not terribly clear. By ancient Marx means slave economies of Greece and Rome. These were preceded by societies like Sumaria, Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt. These pre-classical society are characterised by the state ownership of land, scarce resources and political despotism



What are the predictive elements of the theory? That capitalism won't last forever and it will be replaced by a form of society that will be more efficient. Doesn't particularly speak to communism or class struggle

## Criticism

Lecturer doesn't think these criticisms are particular strong - there are good responses to each (but he will not elaborate on them)

**Textual worries**, for example concerning the status of the 1859 Preface. There are lots and are partly that the kind of account given is dependent on a particular text. Is this an over-reliance on something that is problematic? Are there good reasons to think of it as assumed as a sound theoretical summary of Marx's considered view? One work amongst many. In some sense M replaced it with Capital. Subject to censorship (like all of Marx's German published work). Seems that the text has a weird place contextually.

**Methodological worries** - for example how unelaborated the character of functional explanation is. Functional explanation can be justified in evolutionary biology but it is not so clear how it applies on a political/economic level. M didn't tell the individual levels of behaviour that aggregate up into the widescale patterns. Not hitherto elaborated. Some might say that functional explanations do not need full elaboration. Others might say that it is required to give the theory any weight

**Coherence worries** - lots of them. For example concerning the base/superstructure distinction. Some argue ownership is a legal relation but law is in the superstructure. Then there is no clear conceptual divide. If there is no divide then it is harder to make the claims that Marx does. 

**Truth worries** - whether or not the theory gives a plausible account of the past. There are lots of quasi-empirical claims that we can test and these do not all lend themselves to Marx's claims. Eg in strong/weak reading of the development thesis. The historical evidence may be closer to the weak version than the strong. Example of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire - a step backwards?
