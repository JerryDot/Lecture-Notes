Some of the achievements and failings of capitalism (from a marxist perspective)

M thought the current democratic, capitalist state was an improvement in some kinds. Might not go deep into the rationality of some markets. Lecture will only be about some of the interesting things that might be included under the heading (so is somewhat selective - not exhaustive).

From last week - M considers capitalism one of the epochs from which humanity has progressed. How more precisely can we characterise it?

> A form of society organised around an economic structure in which immediate producers own their own labour power (but no other productive force) and the goal of production is the accumulation of capital.

This definition has two threads - the ownership of labour and the stated aim of production.

# Failings of Capitalism

## Alienation
Marx is interested in the feeling of working under capitalism. The basic idea is about the separation of a subject and object that properly belong together. This represents in capitalism in the dysfunctional separation of modern workers from their product; productive activity; other individuals and their own nature. These are 4 areas that Marx identified. Workers have no autonomy over their own work product or process. Marx thought of work relations as socialising relations.

These claims about work are distinct from other claims about work. Alienated work could in principle be well-paid, secure and short hours - the rub lies elsewhere. Work for Marx can be creative/personally worthwhile. He does not like the view that work is a necessary evil - in a different form of society this need not be the case(?) //This seems a bit unlikely to me - are there not jobs that cannot be so?//

Note not all separation is problematic and there can be social relations where there is no baseline assumptions of any connection requirement.

There might be another baseline condition that makes alienation a problem: capitalism can undermine the importance of self-realisation ie the manifestation of the development and deployment of our innate human characteristics. There is a contrast between work as it is and work as it might be - alienated vs creative and fulfilling for example. Capitalist work undermines any requirement for these components of human flourishing to be met.

Capitalists might disagree that this kind of work is alienation - they likely would have a different view of human nature. Maybe based around free will and the need to survive - where work is able to be viewed in a much more favourable light.

Marx claims: 
* Some systematic forms of alienation exist in pre-capitalist societies (eg religion is viewed as alienation)
* Certain kinds of system forms of alienation are a feature of class-divided societies only
* Greater alienation in capitalist societies than in pre-capitalist societies
* Not all societies are scarred by class division

Does the idea of alienation shift over time for Marx? Are there distinctions between subjective and objective alienations? They typically go hand in hand but maybe there can be cases where it is useful to have separated the concepts.

Eg there may be members of the proletariat that are ok/at ease with their position which would be an example of a lack of subjective alienation.

## Exploitation
The feudal serf is exploited as they spend parts of their time working for their lord. This could take a variety of forms from time spent to produce provided to tax etc. Part of what he/she produces does not belong to him/her. 

The case of capitalism is both analogous and disanalogous to this situation. The employee does not earn the full amount of their labour which is appropriated by the capitalist (owner of capital). But there is some kind of freedom. Plus the producers do provide tools to their employees that may be required for them to complete their work(?) Capitalism works in a certain way as opaquely - the "sphere of circulation" obscures what is happening in the "sphere of production". The sphere of circulation (or exchange) may have no cheating - might be consistent with capitalism that you exchange the full value of your labour etc. But when a capitalist has bought labour then the replacement value is no longer required to be equal. It is not as obvious that people are being exploited under capitalism while it still may be true. Would you still want to be a capitalist if you only had one choice of job?

Does exploitation here link to a moral wrong? Where is this wrong located? Harm, non-reciprocity, force, injustice, vulnerability, domination might be answers to this question. This question won't be examined further today.

## Injustice
Three interpretative positions that it is possible to hold (of which two are plausible):
* Marx did not _condemn_ capitalism - he only described and explained it. Did not give normative critique
* Marx did _condemn_ capitalism but not as unjust - rather because it is hostile to freedom/self-realisation/some other good
* Marx did _condemn_ capitalism as unjust

The third position is superior. First position is implausible. Also consider the possibility that "Marx thought that capitalism was unjust but he did not think that he did so". Look at John Stuart Mill in Liberty where he claims to be utilitarian but fails to show it.

Bad reasons to go for the first/second positions:

Quote that suggests that the value of labour is increased by the capitalist who buys it and ends with a "lack of injustice". But fairly clear that this was a limited claim so is simply taken out of context.

Marx didn't like appealing to justice. But that doesn't mean that there is not injustice. Marx also makes such appeals by characterising capitalism as resulting in exploitation, embezzlement etc

Standards of justice are internal to certain forms of society. 

# Achievements of capitalism

## Capitalism make socialism possible (even inevitable)
Socialism can only exist if the productive forces are of a sufficiently high level (an objective condition) and there is a historical agent to bring it about (a subjective condition)

Capitalism creates both of these! Last 100 years contained more boundless growth than the entirety of history before that. It brought human beings to the brink of abundance. Socialism only possible from here. Premature attempts in revolution would end in the restoration of capitalism. This prematurity would be determined by the level of productive forces. When there is no scarcity, then conflict over it is gone and socialism will be possible.

Marx has no time for a romantic critique of capitalism that opposes smoky factories and technology. He views these as part of the solution that will lead to socialism. Tech growth and human progress go hand in hand. The idea "to each according to their need from each according to their ability" depends on these factors.

Note that Marx has a lack of commentary on the ecological effects of capitalism

## Freedom from engulfment (against "rural idiocy")
Capitalism rescues us from being forced to distinguish ourselves from our social role/community. Ie it is the opportunity to reinvent oneself/a type of social mobility (even if it is still limited by the capitalist system). There is still a loss of harmony involved in capitalism that can only be recovered by socialism. 

In some sense this achievement includes the increase the awareness of the restraints that people experienced.

Thus this is again in contrast to the romantic view of pre-capitalist idyll. Marx saw an emergence in individuality even if it is distorted in capitalist form.

# Concluding
Marx is not a one-sided/negative critic of capitalism. He saw it in a more complicated and sympathetic light than is often realised.
