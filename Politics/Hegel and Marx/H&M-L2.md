## Last week:

Hegel's metaphysical views, philosophy of history and connections between those two

Reason creates and governs the finite world ex nihilo and immanently. History represents a series of epochs as Reason and its embodiment convergence

Now believes the Germanic world is satisfactory and embodies the rational state

## An Aside - How to read the _Philosophy of Right_

### It was based on a lecture series on Political Philosophy. Had structure of:

* Official formal text
* Remarks - less formal comments
* Additions - from student transcripts of what Hegel said during the lectures

Official text is normally the comparatively hardest bit to understand. Sometimes there might be multiple editions from different lecture series. Normally their transcriptions are nearly alike.

### Book is split into three sections: Abstract/Property, Morality and political life:

* Abstract about ideas
* Morality - how to understand moral responsibility for one's life
* Major principles and social institutions of a rational social life

First two on their own do not give you the whole story according to Hegel - eg Kant's account of marriage (property based view) - Hegel suggests that there is something more going on by looking at embedded social context.

Hegel thinks the appropriate moral standards are social standards. The third section incorporates the insights of the previous two. The third section is by far the most important. Introduction is by far the hardest part of the book.

### Work chunk by chunk (not sentence by sentence)

### Use secondary literature. Makes sense to read them alongside with the original text.

Michael Innwood's Hegellian dictionary is a useful 

# Preface
More accessible than the introduction

Interested in the relationship between philosophy and the world - between theory and practice.

Hegel describes his view using two images: the "Owl of Minerva" and the "double dictum"

### "What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational"
Seems to be very conservative - seems to suggest that whatever currently exists is rational. But Hegel does not regard "actual" to be the same as "exist"

Things are only actual in the sense that they are true to their inner essence (which is Reason for Hegel).

But sounds like a definitional tautology. Remember that Reason is a sort of active process and therefore the double dictum should be regarded in the context of History

Therefore it can be read as an affirmation of the tendency of Reason to actualise itself. "What is Rational becomes actual. World History is characterised by the closing of the gap between what is and what is actual.

### Owl of Minerva
"spreads it wings only with the falling of the dusk"

Metaphor for philosophy - is the symbol of the goddess of wisdom. Makes two points about philosophy and the world:

* Philosophy should not go around issuing instructions about how the world ought to be. It is inequipped for this role
* Philosophy is the thought of the world - only after actuality has gone through its completed process and reached its final state. To "comprehend what is".

Plato captured some essential truth about Greek ethical life. Ancient life embodied some kind of substantial social life. Identified specifically with their community. Thought it was defective

Plato was hostile to freedom because he understood how corrosive the freedom would have been to the ancient Greek world. But once the idea of subjective freedom was out in the world it would be unstoppable. Because the ancient Greek world was on the brink of destruction by the reflective morality of Socrates etc. Discussing Plato announced the ambition of Hegel's own work.

Although the enterprise here is to understand the world; not change it, it is important for Hegel that this change in people's understand is itself of momentous significance. Useful to know about Hegel's view of alienation to understand this

## Alienation
A concept used to describe a dysfunctional or unnatural hostility between entities. The loss or lack of something of value. Can be split into objective and subjective

Subjective: the presence or absence of certain beliefs or feelings eg an individual doesn't "feel at home" in modern social arrangements. Not a way of deprecating alienation

Objective: individuals are alienated because they are unable to realise their characteristic (eg confined by social arrangements/institutions)

Hegel's goal is for there to be no objective or subjective alienation. The thought that he started in a situation of "pure subjective alienation". Objective is absent because the central institutions of the Rational State are all judged to facilitate the actualisation of individuals as members of a community. Therefore objectively the modern social world is a home.

But still subjective alienation as people do not feel at home (even if it is objectively). To overcome this, we must change the way the world is understood by its members. This is part of the reason why Hegel's work is important

What were the actual conditions like during Hegel? Do they allow us to take his position seriously that the Germanic epoch was sufficiently close to Reason? Looking for things like prejudice, slavery.

Modern institutions promote freedom and Reason. Subjective freedom requires individuals to follow their own personal goal. Means there is an absence of constraints to them. There are sufficient choices for individuals as well.

Objective freedom exists when we are not limited by or dependent on anything that is essentially other than ourselves. Self-owning and being self-sufficient in a variety of ways. Something that isn't yourself is anything that "doesn't share your essential character". Being with oneself

Germanic world has to adequately employ and encourage Reason and Freedom. But what does this look like - this is part three

# Ethical Life
Ethical life is different from moral theory. It is embodied in the customs and institutions of one's society. Modern ethical life has three elements: the family; civil society and the political state

## The Family
Hegel not particularly common in inviting the discussion of the family as a political discussion. You may not like his opinion of it though! He saw the family as nuclear and patriarchal.

Provides an element "substance" - a felt identification (not rational reflective) - experiential links with something other/larger than oneself.

Paradigmatically states that women are rightfully excluded from civil society and the state. In the Rational State they would not have political rights; just human rights. Interesting to work out where you think the problems are in Hegel's reasoning - it isn't just all unreflective prejudice.

## Civil Society
Distinct between the family and the political state. First to so emphatically declare the difference between civil and political life

Agents pursue their own particular interests. Each is their own entity. Includes the economic life of the community and the legal aspects that encourage this. About the bourgeouis - not the citizen. About many aspects of administaion including the administration of justice and the role of corporations and police.

This is where freedom is given its full sphere of individualism. Anyone can flourish in civil society without allowing it to run rampant and destroy the elements of the community.

Resist the idea of this as a sphere of unrestricted capitalism. He is always clear that it unites as well as divides individuals. Linked with something larger and more universal. Talks of a business estate and an agricultural estate. 

The state extends into civil society - the extent and difference is about its "location" - if it is concerned with the common good then it is part of the political state. If it is concerned with individual adjudication then it is the extension of the state into the civil society.

He was keen on provision of public goods and education for the poor etc.

H acknowledged that society had an amount of poverty. Thought of it as a necessary consequence of the normal functioning of modern moral life. H talks about possible solutions eg corporations can look after their members etc. But he doesn't think any will be fully successful. This looks like a significant concession (and H does not seem to realise this). How can we eliminate alienation if there is a proportion of society that cannot be protected/provided for?

//Do you need there to be a way to "fail" economically?//

## The (Political)/(Rational) State
A sphere of the common good. Not concerned with particular interests but with the community. If someone thinks that the State is about obtaining individual's interests then they are mistaken in H's account

Crown - single hereditary monarch with council of ministers. They are the locus of the community's self-determination. There needs to be a literal embodiment of the will of the community in an individual

Executive - professional civil service devoted to the common good. Full time job pursuing the common good.

Legislature (crown, executive and estates assembly) - with individuals participation through corporations. Your corporation in civil society would send representatives to the state.

H disappoints the modern reader with the problem of limited participation via this view. Looks like a restricted account of what is desirable or possible. We mainly participate with public discussion or paying taxes and occasionally send a corporation representative. H has a modest view of the possibilities.

# H and contemporary Prussia
The institutions in H's writing were not similar to the institutions of Prussia of the day. Any contrarians at the time may have been writing politically rather than philosophically.

Eg exclusion of Jews etc 

What doesn't follow from that lack of fit?

# To conclude
The structure of ethical life forms a dialectical pattern (meaning it has three parts of the right kind):

* The family: a stage of "undifferentiated unity"
* Civil society: a stage of "differentiated disunity"
* The State: a stage of "differentiated unity"

On H's account this is not just a coincidence - the modern world reflects the dialectical structure of Reason as in his metaphysics
