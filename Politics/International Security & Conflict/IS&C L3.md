Terrorism - Dr Jonathan Leader Maynard; New College

This lecture is too long!

Clearly a security threat of the 21st century - certainly a high priority in places that are the most secure via other means. Eg Norway a credible peaceful society has terrorism as the main form of political violence that can affect its citizens.

Rightly or wrongly, it dominates security discourse in many of the most powerful states in the world. (May overdominate) But it has important political consequences. It is also utilised politically around the world. It can also be used to delegitimise political opposition. Eg Syrian government frames the opposition as terrorists.

How we conceptualise it. Vexed and boring debates

Shape of terrorism in the world today. Major trends and distributions, and myths.

Causes and potential drivers and theories.

## First to anchor ourselves

* Ulrika Meinhof - main founder of left wing group in 70s Germany. Became radicalised due to attempted assassination of someone else. Participated in attempt to free a left wing arsonist from police custody. Organised robbings and bombings. She was accused for 4 murders and 54 attempted murders. Died in police custody.

* Anders Breivik organiser of 2011 Norwegian attack. Became right-wing and joined Progress party in Norway. 21 tries and fails to be conscripted. Lived with his mother. Wrote a long and boring manifesto. Killed 8 in a bomb in Oslo and 69 by shooting a youth camp. Claimed the act was to get people to see his manifesto. Aim was anti-islamification and anti-feminism.

* "Jihadi John" born in Kuwait, son of a policeman. Family moved to London at some point. Liked S Club 7. Teens showed some anti-semitism and anti-GWB/TB. By mid-20s was obsessed with religion. Left for Syria to join IS. Beheaded a journalist and was later killed by a drone strike.

* --- Mahmoud. Organiser of Westminster bridge van attack. Involved in crime and prison in his youth. Married and divorced three times. Over his life had violence problems. 2004 onwards involved in Islamist networks. On MI5's networks from early on. 2017 drove into a crowd on Westminster bridge

These stories are all pretty different - there is no single profile explaining why individuals get involved in terrorism. Typically some period of radicalisation. Typically have some kind of trouble in youth (but not destitute). Some of their radicalisations were personal, others "found a cause". Group organised vs "Lone Wolf". Not a homogenous phenomenon. Two important levels of analysis:

Why does a given individual become a terrorist?

Why is the terrorist movement/wave occurring at the time that it is?

## Concepts

"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter." DON'T USE THIS IN EXAM ANSWERS. Boring and not really true. There are different conceptual elements. Kinds of elements include:

* Communicative logic - the targets of terrorism are not the targets of terrorist communication
* Political ends
* Non-combatant targets (?)
* Some limit it to non-state actors
* Non-territorial actors (do not control a territory)
* Illegitimate (?)

Some of these can make labelling a terrorist act controversial/difficult.

eg Ruth's attack on Black church. Was this a hate crime? Did it fulfil all the above criteria as a terrorist act? 

Debatably not political, not coersive - just an isolated act of violence.

Global Terrorism Index 2017 definition

FT convention 1999 definition

Part of the problem is that terrorism occupies a blurry wide conceptual space that is not mutually exclusive with other forms of violence. _Eg insurgency in civil war - use non-conventional tactics. These may includes things like assassinations of politicians or targeting police/civilian structures. All of these acts may be called terrorism_.

Mafia engage in violence against civilians. Sometimes they kill a judge or prosecutor. Where is this terrorism? IT clearly overlaps with criminal violence. Increasing pattern in modern terrorism.

"Pure" terrorist organistions are hard to come by. They often target militaries or state structures (not just civilians). Compare the targets of terrorism. de la Calle and Sanchez-Cuenca 2011.

## Characterisations

First to dispel myths;
* **Terrorism is a revolt against the West.** NO. Since 200 around 2.5% of terrorist casualties were in OECD countries (<1% once 9/11 is excluded). Most targeted group are Muslims. Questionable that it is purely a global clash.
* **Terrorism is rooted in psychological illness.** NO. By and large not insane - found to be psychologically normal. Richardson 2006. Eg Breivik's diagnosis overturned. The psychiatrist account was not set up to consider the possibility of political violence. Don't need to be clinically insane for this. (although did find that he was anti-social and narcisstic)
* **Terrorism is generally effective** VERT CONTENTIOUS. Primary goals achieved less than 7% of the time. Gropus that principally engage in terrorism are less successful than groups that are primarily guerilla operation... Abrahms 2006. Unclear whether it can be rational since there are few alternative options to "win".
* **9/11 started the age of terrorism."** NO. Europe saw roughly as many terrorist attacks in the 70s,80s as now. Global terrorism has been relatively stable until 2012-15. IRA, Red Army, etc before. Some important differences but the scale is not particularly different.

### Realities

213,000 deaths since 2000. Significantly more than many small armed conflicts. IN terms of numbers of actors involved may be a significant threat. When placed in terms or other kinds of violences, it is much lower than global armed conflict, violent homicides, illegal drug use.

Extremely unevenly distributed in the world. 5 countries count for 75+% of casualties. Nigeria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan. 60% of all casualties caused by 4 organisations (Taliban, Al-Qaeda, Daesh, Boko Haram). Hugely linked to conflict and destabilisation more broadly.

99% of fatalities are in countries with high political violence, armed conflict or repression. Tactical shift worldwide (especially since 2014) in the methodology. Movement from highly orchestrated international attacks and bombings ---> guns in conflicts, stabbings and use of non-violent equipment like trucks/cars. One explanation is that it reflects how organisations have adapted to state counter-terrorism efforts. Hi-tech counter-terrorism has vastly improved the identification of hi-tech terrorist plots. Simpler efforts are much harder to avoid.

Big increase in early 2010s. Most related to destabilisation in the Middle East and also the Iraq War. Not as strongly linked to the Arab Spring as it is to situation in Iraq (post-war) and Syria Civil War later. Part of the explanation cannot be linked to general causes but to geopolitical changes.

## Theories and Causes
**Is terrorism rational?** Lake 2002, Pape 2005, Kydd and Walter 2006, Abrahms 2006.

A "weapon of the weak" for individuals/organisations with few other avenues to success. Good details in Kydd & Walter. Explains what could be done with terrorism. (can be utilised for short-term consequences rather than achieving long-term goals).

BUT strategic/reasoned =/= rational (sometimes conflated in the literature). There are lots of weak groups in the world that do not engage in violence. Might have expected more to take it up

Low efficacy and wide availablility of non-violent alternatives. Non-violent modes of political contention eg civil disobedience have a higher record of success than terrorism. Check out reading list. Chenoweth.

**Ideology in Terrorism**. Terrorist organisations often act in ways that seem inconsistent with their stated goals. Eg AL-Qaeda's tendency to kill Muslims etc. 

Why do groups target homosexuals or religious minorities etc. They reflect ideologies; not conflict

Two main factors - size of the terrorist organisations and their ideology. Religious and Ethnonational > Religious > Ethnonationalist > Base > Left-wing. Asal and Rethemeyer 2008.

Environmental organisations didn't get on the chart because they didn't kill anyone. 

Observable ideological patterns are not matched by a consistent ideological profile of terrorists - a _macro-micro_ paradox. Most of the rank-and-file are not fully involved with the ideology but are not purely self-interested either. Leadership more ideology-based?

Governments talk about terrorism as extremism - embedded in deeply other values that are not related to us or our societies. Something not entirely right about that picture. Lots of declarations from terrorist organisations are framed in familiar terms. Eg Ramzi bin al-Shibh did not want to kill more Americans than they have killed. Noted that civilians are normally off-limits.

### Other Drivers
Social Networks (Atran 2008) 0.5 through direct contact with existing members, 0.2 of this through family/friends, 0.2 of this through internet only. Terrorism typically a form of networked violence.

Ineffective and risky strategy in stable states. 

Poverty causing terrorism is rejected. But other similar factors may be identified.
