# International Security and Conflict
This lecture course is to help students think analytically about the topic (it does not constitute normative theory)
## First some cases to think about

**ISIS - non-state actors**

Recent big shift from the US to allow Turks to attack Kurds in Syria

"War on terror" -change in Western policy after 9/11. This results in questions like are terrorists states etc

There have been **more walls** since the end of the cold war
Eg Israel-Palestine, US-Mexico.
Borders can also become a security issue eg NI/Ire, Mediterranean refugees 

**UN Peacekeeping** - are they soldiers or peacekeepers?
Who provides the most peacekeepers? Ans: Bangladesh, India etc

**Yellow jacket movement** recent example of political violence (challenging our "security")


## What is Security about?

Security plays a role in deciding who gets what, when and how in world politics (and domestic?)
--Lasswell 1936

Security is about **material factors** eg habeus corpus

Security is about a system of norms, emotions and political identity
Read Fukuyama on identity

Q-step is way to analyse empirically

Recently there is debate around the "irrelevance" of political science/IR
Securitization of issues such as immigration

Read policy reports and try to analyse them critically - identify their theoretical assumptions and whether they are lying with statistics etc

Security is the "capacity to hurt someone else without being hurt"


## Core pervasive questions:
* Security for whom? (and are there trade-offs involved by either necessity or circumstance?) [states or individuals?]
* For which values? (and are they absolute/relative? hard to define objectively. Compare differences between US and China)
* How much security? (eg arms race)
* From what threats?
* By what means?
* At what costs?
* In what time period?

3 levels of analysis:
- international system
- state
- individual


## More things to think about
Terrorism is a security issue. There appears to be a trend increase in terrorism.
Note that when there is a trend line, your first thought should be "is there a measurement error"!
Analytical fallacies are possible - eg terrorism is actually not rising in the world if you remove a few unstable countries from the analysis

Do you feel safer when there is a single unarmed police officer or a bunch of riot cops?
A single unarmed police officer does not carry a gun because of legal system/social fabric which protects from and prevents violence.
As a results # of police/1000 does not correlate well with security.
Infant mortality has been a good statistical predictor of civil war/instability.

Corpses in the mediterranean sea - who should be safe? Should the safety of migrants or protesters be respected by states?
Is there necessarily a trade-off for the security of different parties in these issues?
Is it easier electorally to pose the issue as a trade-off rather than as a nuanced problem?

Can the descriptive and prescriptive be separated?
