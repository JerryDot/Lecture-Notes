# Nietzsche

Peter Kail - Lecturer

Became professor at Uni of Basel at a young age (university was exploiting young academics).

Some of his early themes came from Schopenhauer eg Nihilism - the world is devoid of value/meaning

He was also influenced by Richard Wagner and his project. Ie the way to rehabilitate German culture was as a Greek tragedy as public event. 
They launched the Bayreuth festival as a social-political project. It did not go down well with N. Was regarded as "sheer nonsense" in the philology world.
Later his health declined and he became disillusioned with metaphysical underpinnings.

Early period:
- BT
- UT (odd - insincere attack against David Strauss)

Middle period:
- Human, All too Human (HAH) [represented a move to natural philosophy]
- Daybreak (D) [some scepticism, even of morality?]
- The Gay Science (GS)

Late period:
- Also Spoke Zarathustra
- Beyond Good and Evil
- GM, TI, A, EH

Slightly problematic to split N in this way because Z sticks out from the rest of the writings - there is more continuity between its precedents and its antecedents

## Approaching N - some issues
N's language is not the difficulty - it is fairly natural sounding and not heavily laden with technical vocab

- He does however have a cultural image that makes it hard to approach. eg "Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger"

- Misinformed prejudices

- Anti-truth? Not true - he thought the best way to get the truth is through naturalistic methods. He was very well read in the life sciences

- N's writing style. It sometimes has causal features, consequences and difficulties. It is also very engaging which has both +ves and -ves.

- Some worries about his final words (he was not as careful in the Antichristian). Ecce Homo may have been satirising a certain style of self-deprecating auto-biography

- "Anti-Semitism". Eg he was the "official" philosopher of the Nazi party, wrote about "blond beasts" and Z was given to WWI soldiers. His sister was anti-S and created "The Will to Power" which N had abandoned previously
N was clearly not anti-Semitic in his personal writings. "Blond beasts" refers to a lion or a type of warrior person - eg samurais counted as "blond beasts"

## N's styles of writing
These are the root cause of some issues. His writing is non-technical and engaging. but:

- Sometimes aphoristic and compressed which can lead to "bumper sticker" appropriation

- Seemingly disorganised (this varies from book to book)

- "Interesting" language choices ("slaves" - referring to most people, "blond beasts", "will to power"). Often provocative and deliberately ss

- Hyperbolic, strident and ad hominem. Eg Schopenhauer was a nihilist who played the flute BGE (ยง186)

- "Not philosophy" - an allegation due to N's style being unusual for contemporary philologists/philosophers. Fits in with the style of Spinoza, Plato, Wittgenstein

- "Inconsistent" - mostly explained by a change in views over time.

- "Rhetoric rather than argument" - undermined in that N seeks to explain human behaviours, thoughts, intentions as being continuous with our knowledge of nature. This is an argument albeit indirect.

- Sometimes tries to elicit ideas in the reader rather than outright telling them. Eg "you are not a rational being" vs "you think of yourself as rational but is that consistent in X situation..."

So approach with care. N cannot be skim-read and you cannot read N once. Often N gives the reader guidance on how to read his work.
You also need to be aware of N's intentional rhetorical force. Eg at one point he uses nasty words about women. But at the same time he supported the admittance of women into Basel Uni.
Also be aware that N's views changed across time eg BoT =/= GM

## N's positive and critical project
N's main project is linked to his naturalism. He wants to "translate man back into nature" (BGE 230). At the time this was not uncontroversial.
He does this by seeking what is peculiar about humans but then explaining it as the behaviour of complex animals

In EH he references the Christian portraits of people as showing the virtue of asceticism. Asceticism rests on a non-naturalistic set of means. Therefore part of N's naturalistic project must be to undermine this.

## An Aside on N's moral philosophy
N was not a bleeding heart liberal. His moral philosophy is unpalatable at its core

Dionysus vs the crucified.

Existence/pleasure vs asceticism/meekness. N wanted us at a different picture than Jesus, although he respected Jesus as a human being as being "the one true Christian". (even though being a Christian is wrong according to N's naturalism)

## Published vs unpublished
Splitters, Lumpers and Heidegger

- Splitters only look at the published work

- Lumpers treat all his writing as fair game

- Heidegger believed "all the real philosophy is only in the unpublished work"

- Magnus thinks there is metaphysics and epistemology in the unpublished work. Lecturer disagrees with his conclusion though
