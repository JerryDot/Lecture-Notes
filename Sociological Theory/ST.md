Social/Individual action

Max Weber: "an Action is 'social' if the acting individual takes account of the behaviour of others and is thereby oriented in its course

Methodological individualism
---
We are not interested in particular people
But this is the principle that subjective individual motivations explain social phenomena (rather than class/group dynamics. In this school of thought such dynamics are considered illusory or artificial and thus can't truly explain market or social phenomena)
This is an assumption shared by much of neoclassical economics
It seems like a reasonable choice since reductionism is a proven-useful scientific heuristic (Popper 1982 was referenced here but I'm not sure what it refers to so possibly I am mistaken.)

Individuals are observable
Individuals' actions "can be understood" (to some extent maybe. Some will argue that it is incredibly difficult or impossible for a person to reveal their motivations)
