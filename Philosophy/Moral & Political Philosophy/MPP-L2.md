Two topics in this lecture. In future lectures will start at 2:15

# 1. Nietzsche

Sometimes characterised as an anti-moralist. He is very elusive - lots of claims and thoughts. The issue is to try to work out what he is driving at (what is the concern/purpose). Many 20th century philosophers found interesting content in his works. We are going to read GM.

Not a timeless phenomenon - to look at morality and its development historically. What can be learned from this process? Very thought-provoking.

There are two different systems of value: good and bad; good and evil

### Good and bad
aka "master morality", the morality of "higher persons"

N thinks that historically this is the origins of our thinking and experience of value. He says this is the value perspective of those who are in some sense socially superior.

Characterised by:
* Ambition/activity - striving to exercise talents in different ways
* Social superiority
* Social power

"good = noble = powerful = beautiful = happy = blessed" (1.7)
"bad" = lack of qualities associated with goodness (1.10)

Grounded in his study of the ancient world (eg Greek). N was a remarkable philologist but became an independent writer - the ideas he had were not suited to an institutional environment. Rooted in a deep study of historical sources. 

Emphasises achievements and exercise of powers, undertaking endeavours and being willing to suffer in pursuit of achievement. Make something of one's life

### Good and evil
This is a system of values which is a reaction against the "higher persons". Motivated by _ressentiment_. From those who lack the possibilities of those with power and position. Mixture of envy, hatred and resentment.

Involves an inversion of those values of good and bad - promotes the character traits of the weak and powerless

Happiness vs suffering; altruism vs self-interest; equality vs inequality; compassion vs indifference to suffering

### Zoom out again

The preferable outlook to N is "good and bad". He thought the morality of Good and Evil is an attempt for people to reconcile themselves with their inadequacies

There is some question of how historically accurate/plausible N's account is. We are mainly interested in looking how it works though. The centrality of individual responsibility towards what is good and bad is shifted. Individuals can choose evil - it is not simply the absence of the good but the unwillingness to choose it

Not interested in how or why you have certain benefits in life. The question is what you should do with them. Morality focuses entirely on the thing we are responsible for. (other concerns are not of interest morally speaking even if they are beneficial)

Freedom of the will looms large in the Good and Evil. We can be held responsible for our choices "because we could have chosen otherwise". Focus of interest is on whether you did something that was worthwhile or not - the "why" or the existence of free will is not required. Not essentially tied to the individual's capacity for free will.

N thought the morality of good and evil is a degeneration. Trying to shake people out of their complacency. This leads to his critique of values

### Critique of Values
"...under what conditions did man invent the value judgements good and evil? And what value do they themselves have?" (sec. 3) - have they benefited or hindered mankind?

"...the philosopher has to solve the _problem_ of values and ... has to decide on the _hierachy of values_" (1.endnote)

N regards the "higher persons" as a minority - they are the people that N is trying to reach. He doesn't care about the majority. He wants to shake them and strip away the assumption that values are decided.

What exactly is N arguing for? What is he claiming?

# What is N claiming? Analysis

## The debunking of slave morality
Ie he claims that the morality of good and evil is not based on a rational set of principles - it is not the deliverance of reason. It is powered by the psychological need of the weak to control the strong. This is the hidden agenda.

N often seen as a philosophical de-mystifier. There are deeper and unseen causes that affect our action. Marx would say social causes, Freud would say the unconscious, N would say that "conventional" morality (+ G & E) is based on deep psychological needs/resentments

This suggests N is a morality critic. Is he just this though? His claims seem more radical. His objections to the morality of G&E is based on a flawed metaphysics of the person in two ways:

* the presupposition of free-will is incorrect and incompatible with what we know about the world. He believes the belief in free-will to be inconsistent and incompatible with the world around us. [We will come back to this in a later lecture as it is v. important. A lot of theory of punishment relies on the ability to have done differently]
* the presupposition that all humans are sufficiently similar for them to be subject to a single morality

N denies the assumption that all people are equally morally valuable - says that it is against all the evidence. [Consider this as a heuristic for dealing with other people?]

The latter suggests different possible critiques:

### Denying the universality of morality
Is N arguing that there is no one universal morality? Eg different moralities for higher and lower persons?. Should able, talented people pursue different things and not be restrained by the morality of good and evil. They should pursue things according to the morality of good and bad; in contrast to the lower persons. N doesn't really care for the lower persons. Regards suffering neither here-nor-there - it is part of the background and should be endured if required to be great.

This creates a kind of higher-level universal morality that applies to different people differently.

N was not a political philosopher - not interested in how should the state be organised. No fan of democracy though - considered it a way of levelling down. People make decisions that they don't understand and are driven by things that aren't important. Assumes that the political system will keep ticking on whatever but N wants to reach the higher people eg Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche. So he does regard artistic achievement.

//Nietzsche's provocations seem to hit a nerve - indicates that he has identified something that does really exist/matter in our moral thinking//

### Points out the irreconcilability of certain conflicts of value
Can two systems of value be present in the moral thought of all of us? Maybe both G&E and G&B do? Start of section 16. The values conflict _within_ our moral thought and the conflict is so deep that they cannot be reconciled. If so then there is no way to bring them together into an all-things-considered judgement.

//Morality is the way that things have fallen out but it is ultimately a social construction that does not have to be the way that it is. Need to see this for what it is. The idea that we can throw off our experiences and knowledge to attain some hidden reason is implausible. Conventional morality is a social construction. N doesn't answer if it is purely conventional and arbitrary. We normally like to think that parts of morality are not arbitrary - that some are more valuable than others.//

### Denial of the overridingness of morality
N seems to rank G&B > B&E. How is a ranking possible if he isn't just a morality critic? On what basis does he prefer one to the other? As a quasi-aesthetic judgement of which is more admirable? (Foot)

Or alternatively, because the values of G&E are not always overriding, they do not always take precedence over other values.

Can we consider moralities as members of a set with many partial orders that state a morality is better than another if it leads to better outcomes under the partial order? A partial order describes the value of a pointwise state of affairs and moralities are the rules of behaviour that govern the movement from one state of affairs to another.

// Why are no courses designed to investigate or discover rather than lecture by fiat? //

N's characterisation is unclear overall but the next issue has a longer issue and is clearer.

# 2. Amoralism

Underlying question: "why should I be moral?". This is not a denial of the existence of morality. It says, even if there are moral values, why should I conform to them?

## Glaucon in Plato's Republic (Book II)
It is formulated in the structure of justice but equally applies to morality.

Goods can be divided into three categories:
* A) Those things valued for their own sake (not their consequences)
* B) Those things valued both for their own sake and consequences eg health
* C) Those things valued solely for their consequences. Eg money

//What things are valued for their own sake? Need to get a better explanation of this. My hunch is that it can all be reduced down to consequences//

Socrates argues that justice belongs to category B. Glaucon and Adeimantus argue that it should belong to category C. They have three main arguments:
* justice is a kind of social contrct designed to protect from the powerful
* being just is a necessary evil (and so done unwillingly)
* the life of an unjust person can be better than ajust person

### Justice as a social contract
The argument is that people would rank the following as so:

1) Freedom to do whatever they want

2) Being subjected to restraints on what I do in order to also be protected from others' exploitation

3) Being at the mercy of other people's freedom of action

We accept (2) as the second best since we cannot enjoy (1) - due to the lack of power and/or its inherent instability

BUT?
* Are these the only options? What about (2*) Being subject to restraints on what I do that embody a system of perfect justice
* Are there no _moral_ reasons for conforming to conventional justice? If it is a stable system when generally followed then can't it actually be better than the unstable (1)? Ie a shift to a rule-judgement of the states rather than an act-judgement. Still is not perfect as there are ways to improve "conventional justice".

### People only choose to be justice unwillingly (choose not because they want to but because they have to)
Consider Gyges's ring - if we could act unjustly with impunity then we would.

*But* is this true of most people? Can moral considerations be so deeply internalised in someone's character that they could not act like Gyges would. 

### "The choice of lives"
Compare two lives

a) the life of the unjust person who is _believed_ to be just and enjoys of the benefits of their unjust actions and their reputation for justness

b) the life of the just person who is alwasy just but has a reputation for being unjust and suffer terribly on both counts

If justice were really intrinsically valuable then b's life must be better than a's and it is obviously not

But this may be a necessary vs sufficient condition situation - being just may not be a sufficient condition for a good life. (see Aristotle week 5)

## Pritchard - "Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake" (2012) worth reading
It is a mistake to try to answer the question "why should I be moral". We are asking a question for which there cannot be a satisfactory answer - the question is ill-posed.

You are either saying "why is it in my own self-interest to be moral" or "morally speaking why should I be moral". 

The should is either prudential - what is good for me or moral - why should I be moral

### Why should I do what I morally ought to do?
A) Out of self interest?

ie being moral is the best self-interested policy since it works to one's advantage

BUT it is not always in your own self-interest to act morally. Eg when there is no risk of detection, or the benefits outweight the risk of reprisal

ALSO it deprives moral duties of their obligatoriness - maybe I should do some moral but I don't have to do it

B) Because it is a _moral_ requirement or duty to do so?

But if it is the reason-giving force of moralit that is being questioned then this does not provide an answer - it is viciously circular

## Why should I be a person committed to acting on moral reasons
= Why should I be a moral person

### Being moral is instrumentally valuable as it promotes my interests
IE being moral (having a general approach to act on moral reasons) serves my own interests. It encourages others to trust me, cooperate with me and admire/like me. The "best" way to have the reputation for being moral is to actually be moral

Plausible BUT it falls short of being moral again as it is motivated again by self-interest. Guilt is just another cost of doing something immoral. Whenever being immoral tips the scales even for such a person then that is what they should do. Morality is seen more in terms of promoting the agent's self-interest rather than serving general non-self-interested values.

What constitutes our self-interest? Can be complex and will be examined again later

### Being moral is intrinsically valuable

Prudence is about our own self-interest. Morality is about the interests of others as well. Some goods can be both morally valuable and in our own self-interests.

Consider deep personal relationships (love, friendship etc). Can you be concerned morally with their well-being? Being concerned with their well-being is valuable for your own well-being. Extending this to morality is to say that a life that internalises some moral commitments is a better life.

How far does this go?
* It might be said to provide an odd rationale for being committed to morality (one's own well-being) except that this is a consequence of being so; not a reason for being committed. This is a critical distinction
* It doesn't in itself show that morality is necessary for a good life. Couldn't there be a good life without morality?

Is it actually necessary to a good life?
