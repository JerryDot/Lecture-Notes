# Aristotle and his approach to ethics

Nicomachean Ethics - concerned with understanding the good life of a human being. Not terribly interesting with working out how we know this. Not about questions of scepticism! His concerns are about the amorals. Why be moral (rather than what is moral).

Central theme is his focus on the centrality of character to ethical thought.

The human ideal is someone who possesses all the virtues of human life. Eg bodily, rational and non-rational excellences. Therefore Aristotle's view is deeply pluralistic. There is no one overarching supreme principle of morality. 

Aristotle argues that our ultimate goal is a "good life" so if there is a single factor in his morality it is that "we ought to pursue a good life". Therefore ethics is not a constraint on our instincts but a guide/part of what it is to live a good life. Thus ethics is an important interest of ours.

Useful to distinguish two key concepts: eudaimonia ("happiness") and character excellences.

NE is difficult to read. As far as we can understand it was lecture notes (not a treatise). Therefore they can be terse, to the point and do not fill in gaps. Might extrapolate from what he was saying. Also uses a range of concepts such as logos that do not have an easy English translation. Who was the audience for his lectures/ethics? People who were well-brought up and already leading good lives. Unlikely to be targeted at sceptical or amoral people. What was he aiming to achieve? Point is to deepen our understanding of ethics and how it gets into our lives as a whole. If you have doubts about the point of the ethical life - these reflections were supposed to give you renewed confidence in the values of the ethical life. Completely different project to Kant etc (even if there are points of connection).

# Eudaimonia
= "living well and doing well" (1095a20) ~~ "happiness", "fulfilment", "well-being", "flourishing". The many do not give the same answer as the wise (when asked what is eudaimonia).

Can be compared to utilitarian ideas of "happiness":

### Affinity with utilitarianism

Eudaimonia is similarly proposed as an ultimate aim for a human life. Eudaimonia not chosen to achieve some other end. It is the end in itself.

Eudaimonia can be advanced by the pursuit of intermediate aims. Eg target honour, pleasure, understanding etc. These are partially chosen and aimed for as aspects of achieving eudaimonia.

### Contrast with utilitarianism

Utilitarian happiness is a _consequence_ of actions but Aristotelian eudaimonia is partly constituted by good actions. It is "a certain sort of **activity** of the soul in accord with complete virtue". Here soul is just considered as part of the human condition (not necessarily otherworldly).

For the utilitarian actions are only good because they contribute to happiness. For Aristotle, many actions are good apart from their contribution to eudaimonia. It is because they are independently good that they are capable of contributing to eudaimonia. Eg honour is chosen because of itself even if it had no further result. But we also choose it for the sake of eudaimonia. //This seems pretty weak to a sceptical/amoral attack//

Utilitarian happiness is a monolithic good. Aristotelian eudaimonia is a composite good, made up of many distinct goods - all the things that are good in life and contribute towards a good life. 

What is central to Aristotle is doing worthwhile things well. Doing activities (not just staying still). This depends on internal conditions such as character as well as external conditions both constitutively (membership in a community/friendship) and instrumentally (resources/stability). Cannot overcome the lack of friendships by having money - they are different types of goods. Aristotle is not particularly interested in the consequences of viewing one life as "better than another". He wants to understand what distinguishes the two instead.

Aristotle is very sceptical about the idea that someone can develop some criterion for distinguishing what is good. That knowledge is attained through personal experience and reflection (not objectively?). He is very confident that these things can be discovered - he ignores any criticism/disagreement. He assumes it is obvious what is good and all should agree. Aristotle thinks Plato's form of the good is metaphysically misguided. A lot of A's stuff is common-sensical. 

## Fortune, luck

Aristotle did not think that eudaimonia is immune to ill-fortune. Someone cannot have a eudaimon life without intelligence and character excellences. But they are not sufficient - it is still possible to suffer terrible misfortunes. Eudaimonia evidently needs some external goods to be added as we cannot easily do fine actions without adequate resources. He ridicules the idea of other people that a eudaimon person proken on the wheel is still eudaimon.

Basic thought is that the eudaimon life is subject to luck and when it comes together forms something honourable and complete. 

Excellences of character may be considered one such component

# Excellences of character
These is a broader category than just moral areas. These are crucial to a good life as it is indispensible to virtuous action. Virtue is not instrumental to such a life as a necessary means. Virtue is partly constitutive of a good life. Living well involves living virtuously.

Examples of Aristotelian excellences/virtues (that we too would share):
* courage
* temperance
* generosity
* good temper
* friendliness

His moral universe is different to ours - consider N's master morality as an example of how to think of a different conceptual framework. So his virtues are not necessarily the same as our defaults

For A, virtuous conduct involves doing the right thing, because it is the right thing to do, with the right attitude.

### Affinity with Kant
Acts are not right because they are virtuous; they are virtuous because they are right. For Aristotle the idea of "right" is equivalent with "living a good life" (eudaimonia)

In addition to be virtuous the right act must be done because it is the right thing to do (Kant: doing one's duty for the sake of duty). An identification of people that follow laws that lead them to do the right actions without them "living" the actions. This distinguishes intent and acting out as an important part of morality/living well

### Contrast with Kant
Acting from duty is not the only type of right reason. For A there is a plurality of values - you do the just thing because it is just; you do the temperate thing because it is temperate

Doing the right action for the right reason is not all there is to virtue. Virtuous action is right action for the right reason and in the right spirit (with the right attitude). This contrasts the virtuous agent and the strong-willed agent. The strong-willed person has to do the right thing against their inclinations and desires - they follow the law through self-discipline; not from an internal understanding that it is the right thing to do.

For A the virtuous enjoy acting well and are partly motivated by the pleasure they take from it (the "right spirit"). This contrasts with Kant. The virtuous person thus has excellence of character because there emotions and desires are in harmony with reason and eudaimon. Excellence of character is acquired by training in childhood. The well-brought-up individual will find doing the right thing easy and pleasant because of the training of their emotions and desires. Therefore this is a fairly social view - it is important to take interest in the upbringing of children (and this should be of interest to the political community). Regards living well/character excellence is almost like a skill - needs to be taught and developed

Therefore A thinks that the truly virtuous person is better way of living life than the strong-willed person. Some kind of integration to bring our desires an emotions into accord with reason and that we should aspire to this to get closer to the ideal form of life. "No one would call a person just if they did not enjoy being just". Suggests that a brave/valorous person in battle will not abandon their post and indeed will enjoy this in some way.

For Aristotle virtue requires virtuous actions - not merely the willing of such actions. So A doesn't think about the autonomy of people as particularly important

# Virtues and Vices
Aristotle supposed that virtues have associated vices associated with an excess or deficiency of a virtue. This principle seems to be true of both feelings and actions so it would make sense to be applied to virtues. Therefore virtue is a mean - an intermediary between deficiency and excess. It is not necessarily a doctrine of moderation - instead it means that what is virtuous is highly context-dependent. In a given situation we could under or over-react.

Note A's theory looks like doing the right thing in the right way for the right reason with the right spirit in the right respect to the context. So in a sense the insight that A gives is related to the breaking up of "living well/doing or being right" into multiple components that should be in harmony in a virtuous example.

Eg with giving/receiving money there is a deficiency of being miserly, a mean of being generous and an excess of being wasteful. Not entirely convinced by the examples given. Seems to me like the excesses of a virtuous action are just cases where some other factor comes into play...

### Rightness of actions

What makes actions right? Not virtue since actions are virtuous because they are right (not the other way round).

For A right action is determined by phronesis (practical wisdom). It is an excellence of the intelligence rather than of character. It is an excellence in determining what to do in particular circumstances. Requires training and practice to acquire phronesis.

This is a bit disappointing - A doesn't have anything else to tell us other than it is about the ability to make the right judgements. In part a response to value pluralism. A more interested in the morality of ordinary life. Not interested in the high stakes things like questions of rights etc.

A's views are somewhat complacent - thinks that everything will fit together and not be subject to valid criticisms. We can harmonise all these different and complex things in a coherent way. How does A think you should treat other people who you don't have an existing relationship with? Why do they matter? Some amoralist concerns
