Kant

# Universalisation

Morality is based on _reason_. It can be derived a priori. The aim of K's GMM was "to seek out and establish the supreme principle of morality"

The commitment to an end gives the meaning to the commitment to the mean

A categorical imperative defines means as right or wrong.

Categorical iperative are those sorts of imperatives that apply to us regardless of the ends. This is how morality is presented to us - as something that we are required to do regardless of our endorsement or any self-interest. What can explain the normative force of something of this kind. The normative force of these imperatives can only be explained as presuppositions of THE categorical imperative.

Kant is one of the most highly interpreted figures and there are deep disputes about how his arguments are supposed to work. Not entirely clear what his point was (let alone whether or not he was right!)

General idea for moral judgements is that we should be able to will a maxim of our action into a universal law. Some maxims lead to a contradiction in conception or will. Ie that a maxim cannot even be conceived as a universal law or the universalised version of the maxim cannot be willed.

Eg is it permissible to borrow money from someone without the intent to pay it back. I cannot universalise this maxim because it will lead to a contradiction (this process not terribly well explained). Noone would lend in the world where it is fine to not repay. Or regard it as a promise. This would undermine the nature of promising itself - which makes it a contradiction in conception. So this cannot be right.

Consider the maxim of I won't help anybody. This can be universalised conceptually. Kant would argue that this cannot be willed. It would be "irrational" to want to will this because it is in your interests for cooperation to be a universal law. It would be irrational to not want someone else to help you.

If an action is guided by a maxim that cannot be universalised then it shouldn't be done!

### Limitations 
* Formalism. Maxims must be fairly specific to be easily universalised. What is wrong with slavery that can be explained by the fact that slave-owners' maxims of action cannot be universalised? Not so clear where to start or where the contradiction can be found.

* Is universalisation necessary? Some examples cannot be universalised eg Parfit - "This year I will give more than the average to charity"; Wiggins - "I will forgive the debts owed to me".

//Not convinced by those counterexamples. I actually like universalisation as a heuristic for consistent moral grounding. Possibly there needs to be some distinction between oneself and everyone else though?//

Main themes running through Kant are reason and the rationality of human agents.

## Formulations

**Formula of Universal Law**: Act only on the that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. //How is this distinct from the golden rule? is there an act/rule dichotomy as in utilitarianism here//

**Formula of Humanity**: Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an end

The latter entails that you must treat persons as an _end_ in themselves (including oneself).

It also entails that you must not treat persons as merely a means (including oneself). Note this creates an objection to prostitution as it involves treating yourself as a means (to some extent)

Rational nature exists as an end in itself (as rational nature is entailed in personhood). Resembles Hegel somewhat. The latter formulation is predominantly talking about our rational agency - not particularly a different aspect of our "humanity". Rational agency has some kind of objective value - it is the thing in the world that has value separate from anything else. Not entirely clear how/why Kant comes to this conclusion. Reads more like a hypothesis that makes sense of our moral thought.

Doing something because it is right to do it entails that you are a rational agent to Kant. Rational agency is required for morality to "exist". Without it you would not have moral actions or moral worth.

What do these ideas amount to?
* Persons have a special value (dignity)? All ends have a price or a dignity. If something is exalted above all price or has no equivalent then it has a dignity. //This seems hopelessly irreconcilable with how our societies work//

* Persons should be treated with respect?

* Persons should be able to share our ends when we act? Or they should be able to consent to our actions?

What matters is how I treat people - not maximising the good in the world. In some sense it is more good to treat people with respect than to maximise utility.

The F of H is a very influential idea - and is profoundly egalitarian. Everyone matters and has this special status deserving of respect and dignity. There is no gradation of this amount of dignity. It matters how we treat people (each individual).

Trolley problem - can flick the switch but not shove the fat guy. (at least that is the simplest reading)

When morality is grounded in reason there is a general issue for how to consider people lacking rational capabilities. Worth considering. Also do Kant's ideas extend to conceptions of rights. But Kant very driven by a certain kind of absolutism, especially with regards to humanity. Suggests even in extremis we should value these principles
