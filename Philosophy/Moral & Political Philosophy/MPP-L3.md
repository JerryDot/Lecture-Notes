# Utilitarianism
Utilitarianism combines a consequentialist normative theory with a welfarist value theory (utility)

Shift from last week: metaethics to first order theories/normative moral theories. Want to explain what actions are morally good/right and explain why these are good/right.

Utilitarianism is an obvious place to start as it is influential and useful to consider first. (Not the first normative theory or anything!). This is just one possible normative theory - there are many different examples.

Motivating thought: "What matters morally in the end is welfare". Welfare of humans and extended to all other sentient creatures. AIm is to take an impartial view on those matters rather than a self-interested view. Abstracted from our own personal advantages and disadvantages and look as a whole. It says we should promote utility/welfare. We should increase happiness and reduce suffering. 

Bentham famous slogan - the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Putting welfare in the central place contrasts this with Kantian ethics - it is our interests and welfares that are the crucial things; not our reason. Animals seem to matter too in this framework

Can be divided into two parts - a value theory and a normative theory. It claims that welfare is valuable and that we should aim to maximise welfare consequentially and impartially.

# Utility (theories of)

## Hedonstic
Utility should be understood in terms of pleasure and pain. Pleasurable sensations are valuable whereas painful sensations are a disvalue. Sensations have three dimensions: valence (positive or negative), intensity and duration. This allows us to compare different pleasures/pains to some extent.

### Criticisms:
Mill on "higher" and "lower" pleasures. There are "higher" pleasures that are qualitatively different to "lower" pleasures (ie sensations). Eg solving a problem, understanding or aesthetic appreciation. These are regarded as more valuable and aren't innately reducible to simple lower pleasures. Difference between an experience and a sensation. Matters of emergence??

> "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied;... they only know their side of the question" - Mill Utilitarianism ch 2

Nozick on the "experience machine" - imagine there was an experience machine that we could plug ourselves into which would give us any experience we wanted. It could give us a life incomparably more pleasurable than our actual lives. Would we choose to connect ourselves to it? YES LOL. I think I would argue that in order to not want to: you would have had to psychologically condition your own happiness/satisfaction on your life's purposefulness falsely. Can compare this thought experiment to the real world condition of addiction

The theory at least is that most people would not because they want their experiences to be real and reflect reality. They would accept a much inferior experience if it is "real".

## Preference/desire satisfaction
What is more important than pleasure or pain is "getting what we want". This is separate from how they "feel" about such satisfaction. This is in opposition to hedonism's claim.

### Problems
Misinformed desires - we want something because we expect satisfaction when it is achieved. But if we reach it then we'd be disappointed. Were we better informed then the desire would be different.

Incoherent/conflicting desires - often our wants are not jointly separable or mutually satisfiable. This creates the conditions for dissatisfaction and frustration.

Therefore what we really want is "informed desires/preferences" ie if fully informed and rational then these are what we would desire/prefer.

BUT: we have not said anything about the content of desires. Should we aim to satisfy malevolent desires that entail harming other people? Intuitively it seems not. Explore?

ALSO: does desire satisfaction necessarily enhance welfare. Eg what if we have a desire that is satisfied without out knowing? Also what if we have desires that are not aligned with our agent's own interests. 

Griffin _Well-Being_ Ch 1

//Can we condition our happiness on a particular type of welfare? Or can we just reconceptualise stimuli into "good" and "bad" differently?//

## "Objective list"
What things really make a life go well, eg: health, nutrition, shelter, education, meaningful relationships etc. Claim that there are some things that are worthwhile and valuable to peoples' lives. We work out what these are from reflection and analysis.

//Compare evolutionary strategies of different species - which species prefer to kill other members of their species and which don't?//

People characteristically do desire these things. But they desire them _because_ they are valuable - not vice versa.

BUT are these sufficient for well-being? Doesn't desire matter? Can't someone find some of these things to be unsatisfying?

## Mixed theories
Claims that well-being depends upon a mix of goods:
* Substantively valuable irrespective of the beneficiaries views
* Substantively valuable if desired and successfully pursued
* Subjective satisfaction with a life that involves the other goods

This feels like it collapses into desires (specifically informed desires/preferences)

# Consequentialism
Given that we can identify what is valuable and what is not, then how should we act?

What we should do is maximise utility - take whatever action will have the greatest net benefit from the point of view of utility. Called act-utilitarianism. We think about everyone's utility. Our own utility doesn't count for any more than anyone else's. What action maximises utility overall.

## 4 features
The only things that matter are the **consequences** - what matters are the effects of one's actions. Eg torturing someone is only wrong because the effect is to increase the amount of pain. Actions themselves are not intrinsically right or wrong - there are just actions that tend to lead to better or worse consequences. Utility monster?!

**Comparability** - the idea that all value is comparable and can be ranked and weighed. Hedonism reduces value to a unidimensional scale so is quite convenient in this regard. Other theories that have multiple dimensions can still be compared (even if there is no general rule - it is just more difficult). This facilitates _inter-personal trade-offs_. Situations where one person's loss of utility can be mitigated by other peoples' gains. This is really important as it is the feature that allows you to aim to maximise overall utility. Lots of these decisions cannot be made with precision but that doesn't mean that this is not the correct conceptual framework.

**Maximising** - an action is right iff its performance maximises utility. (alternatives that do not require axiomatic maximisation - eg satisficing). Why settle for less if you can do better? Why would you not pick the most good option? Is that not rational?

**Negative responsibility**: acts and omissions of acts are on a par. An agent is equally as responsible for what they fail to do as for what they do do. This includes doing and allowing (DDA). See Normative Ethics for more detail. Also includes a responsibility for the actions of other people as well (if their action could have been prevented).

# Criticisms of consequentialism

## Distributive effects
Utilitarianism is insensitive to the question of how utility is distributed between different people. If utility can be maximised though massive inequality then it should according to pure utilitarianism.

Rawls _Theory of Justice_ s.5

But:
* Every moral theory involves trade-offs (eg burdening one to benefit another). Surely this doesn't involve failing to respect the "separateness of people"?
* Diminishing marginal utility - generally speaking the same amount of some good eg money has greater utility to those who are worse off, so perverse inequalities are unlikely to be reached under utilitarianism

Total utility vs Average utility

How much should we help the severely ill/disabled?

## Demandingness
Organ transplant case. No action is intrinsically ruled out as maximisation is the only concern. A person is required to sacrifice their life in order to save two lives for example.

Eg bombing Hiroshima - we transform the murder of 80000 civilians from something evil to something required to be done for good.

Note that things like the Geneva Convention do not take the consequences into account - they are non-consequential regulations.
