Last time just setting up H's version of ideas. This time is much more exciting

# The "Logic" of the Treatise
Faculties, Relations and Causation (to Causal Inference). Work in process in a great hurry. Not as polished and orderly as you might hope. But it therefore shows us the work in action of a philosophical genius

Section 1.2 is on Space and Time (this is not covered in this course - there is an appendix). Worth knowing about and isn't terrible exciting. The arguments are not strongly. Does not feature in his later work. If you are an empiricist then the nature of mathematical proof can be a problem. Geometry was a problem for Hume. If all our ideas come from experience then so do our experiences of lines etc. So how can we obtain the idea of an infinitely thin line with infinitely many points. Hume liked atomism - wanted our lines to also be divisable. Argued that there is no contradiction in denying infinite divisibility. In Enquiry he changes his tack - allows Geometry to allow total certainty (which was denied in the Treatise).

## Faculty Psychology
Most of the discussion at the time presupposed a certain knowledge about faculties. This causes difficulties.

Hume will raise doubts about some important principles of our thinking eg induction and belief in external objects. Wanted our reason to be latching on to real objects in the world. Some of the problems HUme had to rethink are problems we have to rethink.

Some of his famous arguments are expressed in terms of faculties.

T1.3.6 - inductive inference results from imaginative processes rather than by reason or by understanding

T1.4.2 - belief in external objects is produced by the imagination rather than reason

T3.1.1 - morality is not founded on reason (is-ought divide). Spurs Blackburne and Mackie with Error Theory and the other thing.

//Does is-ought divide get destroyed by a materialist perspective?//

## Outline of Faculties:

Hume was an elegant writer but he alternates terms. The imagination and the fancy are the same thing. This is a pain! Do not do this in your own writing

### Imagination
Since all our ideas are imagistic, the faculty of having images that are not confined to visual images is our primary thinking faculty. Imagination is associated with the power not only to replay ideas in our thinking but also to do any operations such as mixing on them

### External sense
sight,touch,smell etc

### Reflection (for internal sense)

### Memory
Replays ideas in their original order. Lacks the freedom of the imagination. These ideas are of great vivacity - almost like that of an impression. Thus Hume often refers to the impressions of the memory.

## Reason and Will: The traditional major division
Reason (or the Understanding) - traditionally the overall _cognitive_ faculty. Discovers and judges truth and falsehood

The WIll - traditionally the _conative_ faculty - forms intentions in response to desires and passions.

Hutcheson wrote about these faculties in 1742 Passions answer to reason and reason answers to the will

## Scepticism about faculties
Locke and Hume were both to some extent sceptical about faculties. (despite writing many arguments in terms of these). Locke ridiculed talk of faculties as a source of philosophical error. He would have avoided it if not that it was so much in fashion.

Hume echoed Locke's scepticism. Moliere's 1673 parody - Why does opium make one sleep? Because it has a soporific faculty. This tells you nothing - it is just a repetition. If someone says what explains your ability to imagine things? We say it is because we have a faculty to imagine things. Oops. What is the faculty that allows us to draw inferences about the world. It comes from the faculty of imagination?

Seems self-contradictory. In 1.3.6 H argues that causal inference comes from imagination. But after that he continues to treat the process of causal inference as an operation of reason.

Many ways to resolve this Paradox. Correct answer probably Garrett 1997. (Lecturer's answer was a mistake). 

Hume identifies Reason with Understanding and Reason with Cognition

Distinguishes between some faculties. Never distinguished between reason or understanding or judgement. He insists that our intellectual faculty is undivided.

### Reason as part of the Imagination
Sometimes HUme seems to blur the faculty boundaries. Book 1 part 3 - induction, causation etc. Hume is developing positive theory (not pushing scepticism). Book 1 part 4 he comes out with the sceptical arguments. This is where his faculty structure comes under particular pressure.

He links features as being related to imagination in 1.4 eg the memory, sense, understanding.

To make sense of this, recall that Hume was imagistic. Indeed he attacks the rationalist view that we have pure intellectual ideas. If so then all our teasoning must take place in the imagination as traditionally conceived. Therefore reason cannot be some separate part of the mind. Thus the distinction between "reason" and the imagination must be drawn on the basis of the kinds of principles that govern our thinking. Associative principles are paradigmatically _imaginative_ rather than _cognitive_ - we follow our own thoughts rather than perceiving how things are. Induction _is_ cognitive, yet founded on association.

# Hume's Dichotomy (and the Conceivability principle)
He splits his 7 types or relations into two groups - 4 constant relations and 3 inconstant relations. The inconstant relations cannot be changed with respect to ideas/comparison.

Young man in a hurry - interesting idea. We can split relations and some can give rise to a priori/mathematical truths. Eg proportions in quantity and number as well as causation. These are based on reasoning and causal relations. Nice idea but sadly rubbish

Causal Maxim - everything needs a cause but cannot be intuitively certain. Seems to have been arguing that any proposition that is intuitively or demonstratively certain can contain only constant relations

BUt sadly this is nonsense - there are many intuitive propostions that involved identity, relations of time etc. Eg Every mother is a parent, transitivity of equivalence relations.

Demonstrability is not analysable in terms of relations. What is the source of Hume's mistake? He confused supervenience and analyticity slide 133.

Luckily Hume mostly relies on the Conceivability Principle rather than the Dichotomy as a criterion of demonstrability. Nothing that can be conceived is impossible at least in a metaphysical sense.

Need to read up on this stuff 

including Hume's Fork. The Fork seriously challenged more recently Kripke 1972, Putnam 1975, Quine 1951. Milican argues 2017 that Hume's Fork stands up to these and other challenges.

# Causality
Hume wanted to understand the nature of causation. Has theory of relations and just one - causation is intimately connected with inference. Now H will look at it. Previously he had done the structural stuff because he wanted to get to causation.

We find causes and effects to be contiguous and cause is prior to effect (succession). But Hume seems to indicate that this isn't a particularly crucial matter (T 1.3.2.8). When there is cause and effect there is NECESSARY CONNEXION which is a more important relation than contiguity and succession. This will be involved in Free Will so it is important.

Hume is looking for the crucial extra compnent beyond single-case contiguity and succession. Don't want to confuse cause and effect - the difference is necessary connexion. How do I find this difference. Where will Hume find the impression of this? Hume searched in neighbouring field. Causal Maxim!

Whatever begins to exist, must have a cause of existence. H Argues this cannot be known a priori (and he is right). But where does this idea come from. How does experience give rise to this principle? Maybe this will be answered in the search for the necessary connexion. H never returns and answers this question.

Never denied that everything needs a cause - but did claim that we cannot know a priori

Hume was a determinist though. Everything in the world is based on universal causal laws.

1745 wrote a letter in the context where he was accused of denying the causal maxim. Clear that the causal maxim was important to the cosmological argument. Therefore to deny the causal maxim was to deny god. Looks like Hume meant to defend the Causal Maxim (but failed to).

Hume thinks it is logically possible for something to arise without cause, but that it never does/has. Searching for the impression that gives the impression of necessary connexion. Then goes to discuss causal maxim, then will come back.

# Induction

Leads up to 1.3.6 while looking for necessary connexion. How do we move from observed to unobserved. Will be discussed next time
