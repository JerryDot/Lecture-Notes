Famous argument involving induction!

Last time we looked at Book 1 Part 3 (the longest part of the work). The reason why causation was of special interest to Hume ... 1.3.2 gets to causation which is a crucial relation that allows for inference about the unobserved. Not primarily a sceptical part.

Title is Of Knowledge and Probability but there is barely any mention of probability. Makes sense if you consider how Hume identifies probability in causation(?).

# The Famous Argument

Gets 75% reproduced in the abstract so this must be important! Hume did not reaslise at the time of writing but becomes clearer later on. It was supposed to be mainly a staging post in the search for the origin and nature of our idea of causation.

Would be a mistake to focus solely on the Treatise and ignore the future works. Later he states that all inductive inference depends on causal relations, This assimilation of inductive and causal inference generalises and avoids duplication later.

## Causal Inference is not a priori
In T he starts to argue that causal inference cannot be a priori just because we can conceive of things coming our differently.

"any a priori inference would have to yield complete certainty". "Tis therefore by EXPERIENCE only, that we can infer the existence of one object from that of another". Adam could not predict the consequences of a billiards shot without experience.

In advance of experience, any supposition is purely arbitrary. The emphasis of arbitrariness increases over conceivability over time.

What kinds of experience can lend themselves to inference? Repeated patterns of one thing A, followed by another B. Therefore there is "a new relation betwixt cause and effect... This relation is their CONSTANT CONJUNCTION" - similar definition to "NECESSARY CONNEXION". Eg a necessary connexion is not discernable from a single case.

Contiguity and succession are only valuable if there is a constant conjunction eg the conservation of momentum.

The inference comes first and given that we expect this to hold, this gives us the impression of necessary connexion.

## Question of Faculties
HUme now going to argue that Reason cannot ground the inference. Our inferences are therefore based on an assumption of similarity

The Uniformity Principle. Nonsense from the modern perspective

If we make an inductive inference, we manifest the assumption of UP.

Can UP be found on ARgument? IS there some basis on which we can justify or rationalise our presumption that unobserved things will resemble observed things (or the underlying laws are the same). Can this be found demonstrably (deductively) or probably (inductively). Hume takes over Locke's distinction because he wants to replace "probable" with something that sounds like it allows certainty.

Hume repeatedly says that no matter of fact is demonstrable. Some people think that Hume confined demonstrative reason to mathematics. Lecturer disagrees - think you could derive "there is a round brown object" from "Mars is red and brown" under Hume's theory. So if we want to find a posteriori demonstrative arguments of any complexity, we have to look at applied mathematics. This mixed mathematics is found most clearly in Enquiry section 4 and would allow the lecturer's example.

Therefore Hume does not restrict demonstrative reasoning to the a priori. Hume recognises applied mathematics but does not fully realise the importance of this. "Demonstrative reasons can be used on a posteriori situations to obtain conclusions" is what he should have formulated from here.

After introducing UP - can this be proved demonstrably or probably. In Enquiry he rules out sensation and intuition.

Try to reformulate UP in a machine learning model type scenario

4 kinds of evidence according to Letter from a Gentleman

Demonstation by the CP is ruled out as an argument for UP. Probable argument becomes circular if aimed at the UP. Probable arguments are based on the assumption that the future will resemble the past.

Argument becomes better focussed in the Enquiry as compared to the Treatise. Diagrams demonstrate this to some extent. Diagram demonstrates that the UP does not derive purely from the 4 kinds of evidence. 

This leads to a conclusion that looks sceptical. Not clear why we should extend reason to inductive reasoning. This is a strong argument! Survives to this day and key in philosophy of science.

### Interpreting the conclusion
Extrapolation from observed to unobserved is a "step taken by the mind which is not supprted by any argument or process of the understanding". What does this rule out?

* a priori demonstration? (seems wrong based on Hume's reasoning)
* Lockean stepwise reasoning? (doesn't make sense given the sensory stuff ruled out)
* any cognitive process

Epistemology or cognitive science?

Seems to be explainable via some model where experience shapes the mind maybe? Check up on.

## Therefore?
Reason cannot explain inductive inference, so instead it must arise from associative principles of the imagination.

This associative princple called "custom" by Hume

//Saying please and thank you (ie manners) is a way of training for non-self-interested behaviour//
