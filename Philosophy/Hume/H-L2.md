Last time we were explaining the common assumptions about Hume and how there is more nuance than in a simplistic reading. Not a simple story! The common interest is intense focus on the topic of causation (and some corollary topics such as religion and free will). Existential interest. Gained impetus from Locke - that all our ideas are ultimately derived from experience. "Concept empiricism".

We will look at his Theory of Ideas, Association, Relations, Abstraction (from the Treatise)

# Theory of Ideas

John Locke's Essay 1690 defines an idea as "whatsoever is the Object of the Understanding when a Man thinks". This includes all types of thinking including perception and feelings and reflection.

Hume thinks this is too broad. He splits it into impressions (sensations such as from the blue sky or the smell of a flower or a feeling) and ideas (a thought). Perception covers both this definitions at the same time (so aligns with Locke's Idea).

Impressions can be sensations and reflections - eg thinking about pain can make us feel pain. This is an impression of reflection. Hume says these are either passions (desire for something) or emotions. This is a major contrast with Locke. Locke regards reflection as the notice which the mind takes of its own operations. Locke overlooks feelings and passion. Hume seems to overlook mental operations. This seems to be a blind spot for Hume - eg where does doubting come from?

Hume says that impressions have more force/vivacity/liveliness than ideas. (T 1.1.1.1) Hume recognises that thoughts can sometimes be as lively as sensations. But there still seems to be an inconsistency - are impressions and ideas fundamentally the same thing except for force?

Remember he still wants to depend on concept empiricism. He was looking for a way that ideas can differ from impressions while still having the same content. Later his theory of belief will be a matter of force and vivacity too. (specifically an inductive inference as operation by a quasi-hydraulic transfer of force and vivacity from impression to ideas).

## A Problem
Quite a naive theory of mind. Treats thinking as having certain ideas in front of the mind. Mental acts are very passive - the mind's only activity is to perceive impressions and ideas.

Mind is like a stage with "perceptions as the actors"

## Locke and the origin of ideas
Descartes and other rationalists claimed that we have **innate** ideas (eg of God, of extension)

Locke argues against in Books 1 and 2 of his Essay. This makes Locke an empiricist about ideas. Hume's Copy Principle comes from this

BUt consider that some ideas can be divided up imaginatively into components and put back together. Eg a bananapple. Hume calls this the "Liberty of the Imagination". He seems to turn this into the Separability Principle later (turning something weak into something stronger)

Simple and Complex ideas. Hume divides them so in 1.1.1.2. Simple things cannot be split up but complex may be distinguished into parts. Later he seems to be less confident of the this idea (in Enquiry). But in the Treatise he seems to be sure of this idea

## Copy Principle
"all our simple ideas in their first appearance are deriv'd from simple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they exactly represent"

It is the simple ideas that have to come from experience/from impression. HUme is explicit that this idea comes from Locke and so i possibly not sufficiently critical

1748 Enquiry flourishes the Copy Principle as a weapon against bogus ideas (E 2.9). But in practice, Hume almost always uses it to clarify ideas (by tracing the route to the impression-source) rather than to dismiss them. Eg Hume replaces the idea of the self using the CP.

### Arguments for/against
**1.** There seem to be no counterexamples. Every simple idea has a simple impression which resembles it and every simple impression a correspondent idea. Since the impressions come before the idea, they must cause the ideas rather than vice-versa

**2.** People who lack any particular sense modality, always lack also the corresponding ideas. Eg if someone has never tasted a pineapple they cannot conceive of the taste. A blind person cannot imagine the sight of bread.

These arguments are fairly weak. Thought that Hume took the ideas from Locke and did not properly examine them.

Hume's first argument doesn't seem to fit well with his use of the CP against opponents:

Suppose someone claims to have an idea which doesn't derive from a corresponding impression: he/she simply denies Hume's generalisation and hence his argument for the Principle. Bennett 2002. This seems like a standoff - an exception to Hume's rule avoids the argument that there are no counterexamples. Garrett 1997 mounts a defence on Hume's behalf pp46-8

Second argument:

How does Hume know that a blind man can have no idea of red? Might it not be that the man has private mental experiences that involve the colour red? You cannot connect the ideas without some shared experience. May not be able to communicate it.

Some authors argue that Hume's point is about _public meaningfulness_. The blind man cannot correctly use the word red and they take this positivist moral to be the real point. This seems like a 20th century bias though.

### The Missing Shade of Blue
After arguing for the CP, Hume strangely presents a counter-example - the "missing shade of blue" 1.1.1.10

He seems to think this is not a serious problem for his position. Maybe because:
* The "new" simple idea is being constructed from materials that are provided by impressions so his concept empiricism isn't fundamentally threatened
* the new idea _could_ be derived from sensory experience, even if in this case it hasn't been. Therefore it is still _imagistic_

Essentially he is claiming that you can create a complex idea that might simulate a simple impression


Conceives of thoughts as _imagistic_ as ideas are copies of impression. Assimilates thinking to the having of mental images. This can be seriously problematic though. Eg has impoverished view of reflection etc.

# Association of Ideas & Theory of Relations
Despite "the liberty of the imagination", there is a pattern to our thoughts. Might not be clearly identifiable as deterministic, but there are links via Resemblance, Continuity and Causality

Association is like a gravitational attraction between thoughts. Complex ideas can be divided into relations, modes and substances. Hume is trying to create a taxonomy but is not that interested in the individual components so doesn't talk much about modes or substances.

Locke thought association of ideas was madness. Hume thinks it is central to our thinking

T1.1.5 starts with a distinction between Natural and Philosophical Relations.

Natural is obvious, but philosophical relations can include _any kind of arbitrary_ "subject of comparison" - ie they can hypothesise but what they are thinking of is not related to the natural world unless it does actually "exist".

Hume puts Relations into 7 categories and these correspond to Locke's. Resemblance, Cause and effect, Space and time, Identity, Contrariety, Proportions in quantity, Degrees in quantity. 

# Theory of Abstract/general Ideas

Hume is an empiricist - seemingly ideas must come from experiences. Locke says that you can come by the idea of a general man by observing several specific men. Contrast with Platonic forms as ethereal and otherworldly.

How do general ideas fit into the empiricist framework? Keep ideas/aspects that correspond to all of the instances of the objects being categorised. Eg triangles - what is common to all? Leave out what is specific to each of them. How can you have an empirical, imagistic, triangle that fits with all of them.

Berkeley says this cannot happen. He claims we do not use general thoughts. We deploy specific examples as representatives of the entire class and then abstract back up if we need to update our knowledge of the class.

Hume follows Berkeley a lot.

### The Revival Set:

When I think of a person I summon a particular person as an image. Once I think about something general of this particular person then I bring into my mind ideas of different people (which may either falsify or confirm the generality of this idea).

Go and look at 1.1.7.3-6

### SP - Separability Principle
"We have observ'd ... are also different." - consequence of the previous idea

Argument for - considered as basically trivial
