1.3.2 Hume talked about necessary connexion

1.3.6 He identified constant conjunction (ie regular succession) as the basis for our ascription of necessary connexion and argues that causal reasoning is founded on custom
---
Today there is a controversial part of Hume's work.

Causation is not the only associative relation that conveys force and vivacity to a related idea. Resemblance and contiguity do too. Why does only causation generate belief? Causal inference enables us to create a system of realities that we combine with the realities of what we see and remember. Causation is also fixed and unalterable (mind not wondering in random directions).

Lots of barbs against religion through 1.3.8-1.3.9

Hydraulic system transfers vivid ideas into the structure of ideas behind them in memory. Begins to look like NN.

Hume was a determinist - chance is attributed to unseen causes. Probably judgement is derived from custom. He does not make much argument for determinism - most he does is in 1.3.12.5. 

If this seems hard to believe then, Hume says it requires you to be so sceptical that you are shaken loose from any sort of common-sense experience. 

Remember custom is the source of probable inference but there is also unphilosophical probability. These are cases where probable inference is not smart eg cultural stereotypes. This is not approved of by Hume/philosophers. We can avoid these situations by using higher-level general rules. These are attributed to our judgment to counter our prejudices. There are good ways and bad ways of doing probably reasoning (even if it is all due to custom)

## Necessary Connexion
Necessity is an important part of causation for Hume. We also have the CP - looking for the impression on which the idea of necessary connexion is derived. Need to search for the impression - 1.3.14.1

Key idea is that he is looking for not literal necessity but rather consequentiality - a force, power or energy need not be compelling. The reason he labels/emphasises necessity is because he wants to apply it to free will, "liberty and necessity".

No ideas from single instances - power cannot be found among the properties of matter. Nor from among the properties of mind. We cannot find a specific impression of power either, hence they cannoy yield a general idea of power either.

The actual source is constant conjunction - repeated instances of observed conjunctions of objects. The way the mind works changes. The multiplicity of resembling instances thus constitutes the essence of power. There has to be a new impression somewhere. The impression must be internal as there is no change between the external impressions.

It is a fact about humans that we initially make inferences. How does this give us a new impression? Stroud suggests Hume thinks we get a distinctive feeling of determination after seeing repeated A->B. Lecturer does not agree. L prefers that Hume should have lead to a reflection that gives an impression (ie an extra mental ability). Hume calls it an impression almost as a requirement of his other work. But really it might have made sense to create another category or mechanism.

We believe in causality because we have a tendency to infer. This is controversial - this is a best sense interpretation of what Hume said.

## Hmmmm
"Necessity is in the Mind, not in Objects". Here he refers to the idea of necessity?

This seems to suggest that H doesn't really believe in causality or reality of an external world. Maybe makes more sense to believe Hume meant that "all we can understand by necessity is the inferring relation in the mind".

Hume said that many would find his view unpalatable - there is a bias against Hume's position. "The mind has a great propensity to spread itself on external objects, and to conjoin with them any internal impressions, which they occasion". So this does not characterise Hume's theory of causation - he is criticising a principle of the people not convinced by his arguments.

//Are non-deterministic NNs a thing - they must be surely//


Hume has paired definitions of causes at 1.3.14.31. Thse definitions are not coextensive - but he has a genetic theory of meanings so this is not a problem.

There is a parallel in how Hume treated virtue/personal merit

Afterwards Hume continues to seem to be very objectivist.

There are two improvements in the Enquiry - some quantitative powers are added and there is an increased rejection of subjectivism (there were some such subjectivist passages in the Treatise).
