Nietzschean Selves III

"Person" as a descriptive and normative term. There are individuals for wholm the internalisation of MPS causes problematic consequences - prevents the manifestation of certain master drives. Also distorts their self conception - they will remain in bad conscience due to MPS. Leads to the possibility of thinking in terms of there eing a distinction between "person" as a descriptive (biological creature with some drives) and normative "One should not at all assume that many humans are 'persons' ... the 'person' is a relatively isolated fact" - Nachlass. Gemes has a good reading of this.

Personhood is achieved when one's drives become fully integrated so that the animal is no longer the locus of different pulls but that has realised a singular direction. This is N's ideal of self-creation. A self is created just in case there is a fully integrated set of drives.

### Selves and Conscience
Persons are self-conscious, self-evaluating, bundle of drives. Self-conception is the difference between an animal and a person.

Disputed view of the sovereign individual - a person who has a positive and affirmative attitude towards his/her drives - untouched by the demands of slave morality.

### Character Style and Self-Creation
"One thing is needful!" - create a certain style:
* survey all the strengths and weknesses that their nature has to offer
* fit them into an artistic plan until each appears as art and reason and even weaknesses delight the eye
* the force of a single taste [rules and shapes] everything great and small - whether the tastes was good or bad means less than one may think; it's enough that it is one taste!

Content of the goal does not matter particularly - it matters that there is a goal. Eg Napoleon and Goethe very different but they both had the integration and single-minded direction.

* "strong and domineering natures who experience their most exquisite pleasure in being bound and perfected under their own law" - single domineering drive shapes and structures everything else. N does not care what drive this is but that there is one

### MPS threat
N's strategy against MPS (after Leiter)

With respect to the Pro-object, N argues either that the Pro-object has no intrinsic value (where the MPS claims it does), or that it does not have any or nearly as much extrinsic value as the MPS treats it as having.

Selflessness by itself is not great but bringing about happiness in others is good.

Pro-objects = the various things that we value positively eg selflessness, pity, concern

With respect to the Con-objects, N argues only that the Con-objects are extrinsically valuable for the cultivation of human excellence.

eg suffering and indifference to others have good consequences in the production of further values. This is obscured by MPS

EXAMPLE - suffering. A view is that the primary problem is pain - and this is the main currency of morality. BGE 225. N seems to be anti-utilitarianism

EXAMPLE - happiness and contentment. Either values "trivialities" or brings an end to creative endeavour. "Alas the time of the most despicable man is coming, he that is no long able to despise himself. Behold, I show you the last man..." Z Prologue 5. Once suffering is removed and we are in the contentment state this leaves people happily comfortable like a house-cat.

EXAMPLE - pity. Schopenhauer, Atheism and Pity - GM preface 5. N thinks pity increases net suffering D 134. The fact that someone is badly off - triggers pity that gives you pain as well. If suffering is your concern then allowing pity increases suffering by your empathetic mirroring. Also pity shows contempt towards their state/way of life. Eg assuming that a disabled person needs your help to do anything. Unguarded pity is a form of contempt. Also pity threatens identity - other people's concerns can overwrite your own.

Crudity/straw man objection. Tends to be assertion rather than argument. But N is not trying to argue the higher types out of their attachment to MPS. His writings are supposed to have causal properties not through arguing but by dramatically presenting cases that produce effective responses.

### Paradox of Self-Creation
Morality threatens higher types as its internalisation prevents creative and self-creative endeavours.

Human beings are "pieces of fate" - ie lacking in free will and just a bundle of drives. How can one create or self-create when one lacks any freedom?

N's "Fatalism" - not quite the same as the standard incompatibilist worry. Human is a set of causal tendencies that are dispositional in character. Tendencies to perform certain types of actions and we are the sum. These causal tendencies determine necessarily the course of a life. BUT these are not sufficient - by the plant analogy there is interaction with the environment that can trigger/promote tendencies.

N's writings affect higher types both causally and as a matter of luck (plant analogy). Does this really help with self-creation yet? Leiter concludes that there is no coherent account of self-creation as it is all slavish to circumstances.

Leiter's reading is that MPS is a threat to the creativity of the higher types as a result as there being no coherent notion of self-creation. 

Alternative proposal. Leiter was looking for a self to do the self-creation but could not find one. There is a different way to emphasise things. Emphasis shouldn't be on the self; it should be on the creation of a self. The free individual is a matter of there being fully integrated drives and a conception of yourself untroubled by bad conscience. Very similar to Spinoza's sense of freedom.

You can consider an internal "geography" of drives - N suggests that we can move or make some effort to shift these patterns etc.
