Today is about GM III - meanings of the ascetic ideal. Begins with a long summary of what he is discussing. This summary ends with the question - have I been understood? He then goes on to explain

There is key discussion of the priest. It completes the genealogy in so much as it covers the religious interpretation of guilt. It identifies MPS. Argues that the scientific spirit is the last outcome of MPS and it brings with it a certain kind of problem. "We are unknown to ourselves we seekers of the truth". The natural enquirers find themselves the last outcome of MPS

What is to come:
* N's ideal and going on to the revaluation of values now that we have some contingent distance.
* How N's exposed ideal is a threat to the ideal/nature of MPS "the danger of dangers".
* N's conception of freedom (hot topic recently)

## Priest and the Ascetic Ideal
The priest as inventor and key interpreter of the meaning of _asceticism_. The call to MPS. He is an "essentially dangerous" type - GM I 6. Looking at the psychological disposition of a person rather than just their status. It is another type like masters and slaves were. More complex and fascinating to N marked by key behavioural dispositions.

Priest is accutely aware of the suffering that life inevitably brings with it. Slavish types suffer themselves but have coping mechanisms. Eg by watching football. Priestly disposition is the kind for which beer and football does not do the trick. They confront the endless suffering and is horrified by it. In virtue of this they do not have the luxury of these coping mechanisms and they withdraw. Remove themselves from existence to avoid confronting the awfulness of the world. Sometimes in crude non-symbolic ways. Also marked by a cleverness/reflectiveness. Observe a certain kind of suicidal nihilism according to N.

## Asceticism's 3 great slogans
Poverty, Humility and Chastity. A withdrawal and renunciation of the things that human beings are naturally drawn towards. A rejection of self-interest and ordinary empirical pleasures. GM III 8

Generically involves a negative valuation of material goods, pride and self-interest. Praises charity, frugality; altruism, self-sacrifice, modesty; fasting, sobriety, anti-sexual desire. The makings of a good monk - the explicit Xianised version of asceticism.

NB it is an ideal and the core of the normative component of MPS

## MPS
Leiter splits it:

MPS is pro: happiness, contentment; altruism, selflessness; extirpation of instincts; pity and compassion; peacefulness/tranquility

MPS is anti: suffering; self-love; satisfaction of sexual desire

But can be split into the 3 Poverty categories above

Where does it come from? Priest's psychological type: disgust at suffering; "life against life" and a "suicidal nihilism". GM III 13 and GM III 28. The suffering that they see has no sense or meaning. Bloody confrontation of animals against animals and the vicissitudes of fortune.

This withdrawal can be given a different interpretation by the priest. Ascetic practice (Brauch) of withdrawal assigned a meaning (sinn) or interpretation in order to make sense of otherwise meaningless suffering in the world (GM II 7)

N sees it as a form of punishment. But meaning and significance can vary. There is a practice of "withdrawing from the world" and N thinks there are different meanings in different contexts. How can they consider their own behaviour in a positive personal way. People can endure suffering as long as it has some meaning or significance.

Priest reinterprets the withdrawal not as withdrawal but movement towards a new and better world where all this suffering has some sense and can be revealed. A sublimation of hte "unsymbolic" purity of GM I 6. Heading towards a different alternative world - "transcendent world populated by Gods [Lecturer]". In this context the suffering makes sense and will be redeemed. N thinks this reinterpretation is more likely to be a post hoc rationalisation rather than a guiding purpose - it is unlikely that people first withdrew for this aim rather than the psychological reasons. Reminds us of his view that consciousness is shallow.

## Chief Trick
Drives still have certain kinds of goals as ever - remember the will to power. In this interpretation N gives priests meaning for themselves and a way they can express power over others. They are in a position to give the slaves an interpretation of their own suffering. Therefore the priest becomes an intermediary between the slave types and the transcendental ideas. This is the **"Chief Trick"** of the Priests. Note that the priests can still be sincere and believe in their own interpretation. This allows them to reinterpret slave values with an overarching interpretation of the negation of the master types. Priest can say that the slave values are a coherent whole is because they are a force for asceticism and they make the evaluation of this world as suffering/bad justified.

Slave's coping mechanism = "innocent" relief like mechanical activities etc

"...the exploitation of the sense of guilt" GM III 20 as linked to debts to ancestors. Remember we had lurking guilt around from the consequences of debt etc. Yet to have a fully satisfactory meaning. Speculative anthropology and "rude kind of logic" GM II 21

N speculates that the guilt is given some sense of meaning when you shift towards monotheistic systems. When there is one god you are indebted to a level that cannot be discharged. The priest exploits this sense. We are sensitive to it because we are searching for meaning to suffering. 

In the end all the suffering we have is our own responsibility. Then ressentiment is redirected towards oneself GM III 20. The things stopping me from flourishing is my own inherently flawed nature. Guilt is a punishment for the willful failure to live up to norms (sin). This is a psychologically seductive route.

## To sum up
How do I cope with being a slave? By downgrading the masters and reinterpreting your own situation in a positive way. The masters are callous and cruel. We don't have a coherent interpretation of this set of values. The priest has a way of interpreting this things by telling story of asceticism as an ideal. This moves the locus of good value outside of this world. This veil of tears makes sense and will be redeemed in another life. These "healers" have the unfortunate tendency of increasing net suffering. Now you have pain, terror and guilt that adds to the suffering. Nevertheless seduced by this kind of interpretation. Asceticism is self-punishment and a net increase in suffering and so valorises slave virtues of self-denial. Asceticism downgrades the value of earthly existence. N says this is anti-natural not just because it is a metaphysical fiction but also because it downgrades natural impulses.

## Masters and slaves?
We can see why the slaves find it appealing. N not explicit about how it relates to the masters. Did the post-Christian world lead to greater equality? No - it just became holy. The church was a wielder of wealth and power for itself in a lot of ways. Where do the masters fit in? Priest is a conduit between the slaves and the masters. They can give an interpretation to the masters' existence that fits in with slave morality. Now they can bash in the name of the glory of god. The significance and meaning is vastly different here - think of the justification of the Crusades. Bloodlust and power justified as being in the service of God.

## More on Ascetic Ideal

N gives a different meaning of the ascetic ideal outside of morality - here is a brief mention. Artists and the Ascetic Ideal. What is the meaning of the ascetic artist - why do they withdraw to focus on representing a world better than this one. For them it has no real significance - instead they are given some kind of overarching interpretation. Art as religion

Philosopher as an essentially contemplative life. They are marked very ascetically like Socrates, Spinoza. N thinks that what they are really doing is creating stories affirming their own kind of life. Thinks this makes them novel - Spinoza described a world that justified his own dispositions. Also avoid the three glittering and loud things - fame, princes and women.

## Science
We are reaching the end of the tenability of this idea according to N. GM III 23 about modern science and its relation to reality without God. The God-interpretation is becoming less and less credible. "The Death of God". The significance is the later implications of the removal of the MPS. MPS does not makes sense without another transcendental world. Once this is removed then we lose the morality that is based upon it. No longer have an overaching intrepretation with which to understand the world.

N is thinking of his fellow naturalists. They are now no longer beholden to the metaphysical underpinnings of MPS and its consequences. We now have the ideal of truth-seeking. When Dawkins rants - he rants with a terrifying enthusiasm which is an orientation towards truth. Unconditional will to get things right. The real fault with Christians is that they are just wrong. N thinks his compatriots were also under this spell. All of modern science creates an alternative meaning which is pursuit of truth. It exists independent of God and the virtues of denial etc.

GM III 23. The truth is the opposite of the previous paragraph. Science has no belief in itself let alone an ideal above it. It is not the opposite of the asceit cideal but rather tha _latest and noblest form of it_. Science seems to describe a categorical imperative for truth over falsehood. BGE begins with "why not falsity over truth". How does ardour for truth that is instrumental in bringing down the ascetic ideal based on the ascetic ideal?

GS 344 "In what way we, too are pious". Science presupposes unconditional will to truth so there is a prior question. Suggests that is comes from the value of honesty and not deceiving another. "I will not deceive, even myself"; and here we stand on moral ground. Not clear whether this is a Xian notion. Note that God as omniscient promotes total and maximal honesty. When there is a witness to everything I do then I will never get away with deception - therefore I need to be honest about everything because God can tell what is in your heart. Implies the will to truth stems from the need to be honest to oneself whatever the cost to one's self-conception.

Lecturer invites us to look at other readings - he is not confident in his own view and not convinced by other readings. 

N thinks that the consequence of undermining MPS is the return of a lack of meaning to suffering. This stares nihilism in the face. Which will be a problem that requires a different ideal and a different conception of what humans believe. What kind of positive suggestions does N have? For whom do these ideals work? 

N thinks these ideas will affect very few people. Xianity suits a lot of people. N is interested in the people with the maximal honesty to reject that explanation. Regards the Xians here as not having the capacity to do so. This will be an area of discussion next week.
