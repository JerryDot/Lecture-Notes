Prudential Goodness - from prudential value which is things or actions that are conducive towards a "good life" or well-being.

Debate over whether N should be considered as a naturalist or a post-modernist. Leiter argues (and claims to have done so with some success) that N is the former.

...M-naturalists view philosophy as continuous with empirical inquiry in the sciences. Some M-naturalists want to replace conceptual and justificatory theories with empirical and descriptive theories; they take their inspiration from more-or-less Quinean arguments against conceptual analysis and foundationalist programs. Other M-naturalists retain the normative and regulative ambitions of traditional philosophy, but emphasize that it is an empirical question what normative advice is actually useable and effective for creatures like us. Some M-naturalists are also substantive naturalists (S-naturalists). Ontological S-naturalism is the view that there exist only natural or physical things; semantic S-naturalism is the view that a suitable philosophical analysis of any concept must show it to be amenable to empirical inquiry.

M-naturalism is about continuity between philosophy and empirical inquiry into behaviour from the bottom up.

S-naturalism is closer to physicalism - the only things that are real are those that are based on physical/natural laws. This means morality can only be spoken about purely as an extension of how to "improve physical conditions"

Scientific method > scientific knowledge

"Doctrine of Types" - people have types defined by their fixed psycho-physical constitution. Relevant facts about this are "type-facts". Eg one famous type-fact that N identifies is the "will to power" - that every animal strives for optimal conditions in which to achieve maximum feeling of power. 

Typical form of N argument:

Natural facts about a person ---> their moral beliefs ---> their theoretical beliefs. Eg accepting the Golden Rule is significant because "it betrays a type of man".
