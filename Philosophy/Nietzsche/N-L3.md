Today we are looking at the first treatise. Good and Evil; Good and Bad

Primarily explanatory. There is also a lot of rhetoric involved which is deliberate on N's part.

Exaplanandum of MPS. Metaphysical component that has freedom and desert (meaning luck or being well-born) built into it. But we will focus more on the normative component (eg the ideal of selflessness).

# First Treatise
* Guided by historical and cultural data. N saw two patterns of valuation (master morality and slave morality)
* Centrally is an inference to the best explanation. This is primarily psychological in nature, with some environmental consideration (and its effects on psychology). Speculative account on how psychology reacts to environment.
* Behind all this is a relatively determinate psychology that is a psychology of drives oriented around a "will to power"/drive to control. This hides behind the surface in the first treatise but does seem to lurk.
* It is naturalistic in that its postulates are consistent with empirical/naturalistic psychology.

These are all behind the rhetorical shell. Thinks Englishmen were suspicious of an account of human beings (for which they deserve credit) but he thought they were insufficiently suspicious.

## Gut and ____??
N notes of single importance that there are two types of contrast when it comes to values. Good and evil which emerges as a reaction to good and bad. Bad comes from _schlecht_ which means base, low, common. This is opposed to the noble, privilieged, "high". This is the contrast that N identiies as operative in the ancient world.

Later as a reaction emergences MPS. Gut and Bose = good and evil. Good is selflessness and caring as opposed to those who lack concerns and have ill intentions.

Note that Good and bad is independent of intention, fairness etc. Good and evil ties your moral status towards your intentions and actions. N thought he needed to explain this contrast.

N described these as "master" and "slave" morality (BGE 260). But some sensitivities
* Historical - Homeric heroes, roman generals, samurais as opposed to the mass of poor/peasants who are treated instrumentally. Often literally masters vs slaves.
* Traits - Well-born, healthy, powerful, confident, independent contrasting to sickly, deformed, ill-born. Here thinking of individuals and their dispositions/features.
* Psychological - particularly important to N. It is a feature of their drives. Individuals can be both masters and slaves in the same body representing different drives. 

A drive is masterful when it is a character disposition directed towards an object and is relentless in its pursuit of this object (overcoming obstacles). Eg Stanley Kubrick - extensively obsessed with getting his films right, to the ill health of his actors etc. This is what N thinks a master drive is like. The high-born are in a situation where they have this kind of psychological trait and they have the materials required to pursue these goals in callous indifference to everyone else.

A drive is slave-ful if a drive is responsive and reactive to all the environmental conditions such that their goal becomes compromised.

Schlecht as the contrast to the masterful good. This is weakness, impotence, poor health. Nothing to do with action/choice/intention. N puts forward some evidence for this in etymological and historical forms. Argues that this was the morality before Judeo-Christian morality came onto the stage.

### Slave Morality
People historically did not pursue their goals relentlessly because they could not materially. They recognised that they were part of the weak, the low, the deformed. N claimed there was a slave revolt in morality - a conceptual shift. "Imaginary revenge". What the slave morality instantiates is a way for slaves to consider themselves not as the Schlecht. N thinks they caused the first revaltuation of values. They reinterpreted their standing in a positive rather than negative kind of way. Shifted from thinking of themselves as low, base and weak towards something meritorious as an instantiation of the good.

Negation of the good of master morality. The wealth, sexual prowess etc as part of the noble life become negated. Reconceptualised as bad or "evil". Think that the possession of wealth is evidence of the evilness of a particular person. With this comes a positive characterisation of the situation of the weak types. The slavish types from their weakness have to pool together to survive.

Can re-orient this towards community, reciprocity etc -  "Weakness is being lied into something meritorius". Patience, altruism, love of fellow man etc as "humility", inability to revenge as "forgiveness" or "love of one's enemies". The common theme is the incapacity to act as masters. Now it is linked to intention and the ability to have done differently

## Ressentiment and N's explanation
Puts a certain kind of type psychology and then thinking what would happen if that psychology was placed into a certain type of environment. Thinking about the morality of a slave in that kind of environment (a good schlecht contrast). He thought that in that state they would have a psychological reaction - _Ressentiment_. This is an unpleasant reactive attitude occasioned by the incapacity to surmount obstacles to command of environment. Its object is the masters. "They have stopped me from doing something I want to do. I feel resentful for their obstacle".

N links this to the more general diffuse feeling of how the slaves are. Their entire situation is against them acting in the ways that they want. Everything frustrates their activity and they feel a general unpleasant reactive attitude. Sees this as a dreadfully awful feeling and there is a need to vent/remove this feeling. A literal revenge is not possible given the situation. Instead the slaves opt for the second best form of revenge - an "imaginary revenge". To get rid of the discomfort, one can reconceptualise the object of frustration in a way that makes you feel better.

Eg if jealous of someone else's ability you can find ways to fault the individual not as a rational appreciation of their features but as a psychological strategy to cope with the resentment felt towards the object "eg but he isn't really that good/I bet he/she doesn't have a life because they spend all their time on it"

## Origins of slave morality
They reconceptualise the masters and themselves. This is how N thought slave morality came about to cope with the feelings of resentment. Two interpretations of what is going on here (RJ Wallace):
* _Strategic_ - intentional conscious strategy on the part of the slaves - how can I make myself feel better? By making them the bad
* _Expressive_ - an unconscious pyschological reinterpretation/process as a way in which the feeling of Ressentiment is reconceptualised. Feeling a certain way and try to find a way to conceptualise something. Eg changing thoughts towards "I am feeling morally damaged by these people" from something more masterful

There is some evidence for the strategic interpretation eg the "slave revolt" and "common". Exhibited by the priest. But why should the "imaginary" revenge make things better for the slaves? If it is conscious then how does it help you? Like shouting at a wall to fall down. You are aware that it is not going to work and it makes the subsequent valuations insincere - "I am humble which I am defining as a good thing!".

Prefers to think of it on the preconscious level. N thought most of what goes on in your head lies beneath the level on consciousness. Here the biasing of moral thought relieves the discomfort without revealing itself to the owner of the discomfort.

## N's tone towards slaves and masters
N is more nuanced than just "masters good, slaves bad". N lauds the master types but not straightforwardly. Condemns them for some ugliness - but this is not as prevalent on the first read. First impressions suggest that felt slaves were deformed human beings. N thought most of us are physiologically deformed. This does not entail that he thought they were terrible. Thought that people are more complex and interesting if there are non-master drives. He felt pure master drives was a somewhat boorish mode of existence. 

Ressentiment makes for interesting creatures, cleverer and the is the instrument of culture and has bread a tame anial out of the beast of prey. GM I 6,10,16

### Consequences?
Is N committing the genetic fallacy? But BGE 2-3: the weakness of philosophers that anything good must have good origins. Suggests that he was not

Note that N's slave morality has shameful origins. Some people think he is criticising it purely because it has bad origins (but this does not make it inherently bad). This would be N committing the genetic fallacy. Eg Cricket is a key orientation in India. If you look at its history though it is entrenched in British colonialism. So shameful origins do not necessarily condemn it today.

Is N rhetorically inviting us to commit it? (Leiter's explanation) This seems a little problematic. N intended his readers to be cleverer than that. Note the GM is part of a project of revaluation. It is not itself a criticism of values, but there is something we learn from this story. The values emerge not because we come to appreciate that something is a good thing to do; but instead out of very dubious psychological mechanisms. This doesn't inherently show these values are bad. It does however destabilise these values - it puts you at a distance from them. In order to carry out a revaluation, N was going to face a problem. Similar to when you are arguing against the existence of God. IF the kinds of values I have stem in processes that I don't trust in general then this calls into question whether we should take them as givens rather than comparing to alternative moralities. Makes us want to seek for justifications for altruism (doesn't necessarily say that it is incorrect).

N is very brief to historically confirm this but his examples are quite accurate.

Prinz following Stark. Xianity transmitted via middle class affluent Romans and not the slaves. But N was interested in the emergence of the values (not their spread). Remember he was talking about psychological types. 

Questions:
* Incomplete - we get a generalised account for how schlecht changed to evil but it is not the whole story (and it is not intended to be)
* What about the "priests"? GM 17. N regards them as a dangerous type - will encounter in 3rd essay
* What about the "creation" of freewill? GM 113
* How does the master class take on the slave pattern of evaluation? Who do we bow down to in Rome now? Why would a slave morality be appealing to the master types

Next week: second essay which is in some sense more fundamental. Most difficult essay as well.
