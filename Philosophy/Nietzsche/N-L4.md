Treatise II - Guild, Bad Conscience and the Like

Is the most difficult in the Genealogy. Packed, complex and doesn't follow an order that is obvious. Eg the opening question about how to we breed an animal with scoscience that leads to the "sovereign individual". Goes off into punishment and debtor-creditor relationship. Relation between debt and cruelty. Cruelty becomes internalised to form bad conscience and is related to the notion of guilt.

For some, they think N sees the sovereign ideal as a goal; for others it is a parody.

N's explanation of the phenomena of bad conscience and guilt. Naturalism and conscience - not the "voice of God in man". 

This essay exists as a pre-condition for understanding the Nietzschean ideal and the threat of MPS. Ie this essay supports the story in Treatise I

## From Behavioural regularities to self-awareness
Man is the interesting animal (and the only animal for whom there exists problem). How does one breed an animal with the right to make promises? Start with the establishment of behavioural regularities (the morality of custom trhough the mnemonics of pain). The infliction of pain introduces regularities. Compare the cat and house-training - get the cat to associate deviations with pain; conformity with reward.

N emphasises the stick; not the carrot. A trained cat has regular behaviour but this is different from an animal behaving because they recognise a normative requirement. Does not grasp the fact that it "should do". To be a promise-keeper/an animal with the right to make promises, the guidance of your behaviour has to be in terms of you recognising something normative - promise or a rule and that you regulate your behaviour based on the normative requirement.

Need the capacity to be guided by norms by grasping them. A form of evaluative self-conception. This is a key thing in play for N.

### Explananda (things to explain)
_Bad Conscience_: negative evaluative awareness of one's own behavioural dispositions. "Self-conception". "A conception of oneself that is negative in its evaluative content". Rather painful correstating figure. 

Remember N thinks consciousness is shallow and this is consistent with this idea. The thing we are negatively evaluating is the way that we think about ourselves.

Related to but can be distinguished from:

_Guilt_: negative evaluative awareness of one's having transgressed or failed to conform to some norm. Ie a regret of one's specific acts.

N wants to explain these things and work out how they relate to normative guidance.

Now a strange claim: N thinks that these phenomena are rooted in the human disposition of cruelty. BGE 229. Hyperbole. GM II 16

### Cruelty
Emphasis on cruelty in Treatise II. He regarded cruelty as enjoyment in inflicting pain (and viewing it) which is widespread and instinctual. Brief historical appeal eg forms or torture - GM II 4. Ancient and modern festivals of cruelty eg Roman amphitheatre, The Hanging Tree. Think of a school playground - kids can have a natural inclination to be cruel. In modern life it has been somewhat sanitised - eg taking pleasure from pitchers aiming at batsmen, cheers when there are big hits in rugby.

N sees this as an expression of _the will to power_. Enjoyment in cruelty cannot be accommodated by some more basic desire for pleasure. Psychological hedonism was a main game in town at the time - explains motivation etc. But pleasure seems to be a consequence from engaging with a thing valued. Rather than the pleasure itself.

//Does the cruelty need to be provoked? Feels to me like inflicting pain on someone else gives the inflicter more protagonist power.//

### Will to power
What is it?

"Life itself is essentially appropriation, injury, overpowering what is alien and weaker...it is a basic organic function; it is a consequence of the will to power, which is after all the will to life" BGE 259. Note ORGANIC; LIFE - comes from the biological drives. Drives are dispositions towards certain kinds of ends but are unlike them in that they do not disappear when their objects are met. A drive for gluttony does not disappear halfway through and the next day will return.

When you learn to play a song on guitar. There is a general aim/disposition to be able to play the guitar. An opportunity is presented to learn a specific song. If this opportunity is met then another can take its place as the drive continues. There is a further drive twards mastery/domination.

The notion of domination and control is a consequence of the WTP (not identical to it)

Suggests that drives do not get reduced in the face of resistance. Slavish types will find their drives not strong enough to overcome resistance. They are reactive - there is an object they want but fail to overcome resistances. Leads to psychological consequences eg ressentiment. Masterful types will overcome it.

WTP is the form of a drive that has particular objects. Not desire-satisfaction. It is a tendency towards a particular kind of goal and controlling/overcoming the resistances to that goal more and more.

WTP as a psychologically explanatory category. Form of motivation that is a best explanation account for a variety of behaviours that are not obviously about pleasure and pain. Eg artistic pursuits.

Cruelty is the expression of power and pain towards an object that resists. Exerting your control and dominance over another sentient creature and you are enjoying these. Remember playground. Think of bullying or rubbing others faces in it.

N thinks we all have this disposition. But something happens that is a rupture in human life akin to the fishes coming onto the land. A change in environment that leads to a change in the animal. N hypothesised that there are groups that enslave other groups and use them instrumentally. Eg blond beasts - unconscious artists. They come in, round up other human animals and use them in an environment that they control and that those creatures are not capable of pursuing their own objects. Akin to first essay.

They (slaves) are placed in a state that curtails the natural expression of their drives. Masters are using them instrumentally.

N hypothesised that "All instincts that do not discharge themselves externally turn inward" GM II 16. Freud is pleased.

Cruelty becomes expressed in severe probing and negative evaluation of one's first-order tendencies. If I cannot be severely cruel to anyone else then I will be severely cruel to myself. Also leads to psychological self-harm which expresses itself in the start of focussing on your own tendencies and disavowing them.

### Bad conscience is an illness like a pregnancy
"An illness as pregnancy is an illness"

Creature shifted from being conscious to self-conscious. It is painful because the form of thinking is negative (for one whose cruelty has turned inwards).

It is the "true womb of ideals". If I am not self-conscious in the first place then I have no capacity to think in terms of better or worse. I don't think of myself as myself in evaluative terms. Cruelty makes you think of yourself in negative evaluative terms.

Humans became critically reflective (first developed a "soul"). This imposes a structure or form on "wantons". There would be no beauty without bad conscience

Bad conscience is the first form of self-awareness. Being aware of oneself and being able to be negatively evaluative. This is a pre-condition for being able to think of an ideal - that you failed to meet a certain standard.

Where does guilt come in?

The notion of failure to meet a contractual obligation is then moralised. Unclear whether these two notions are co-evil or whether one causes the other. (Obvious answer would be bad conscience => guilt)

Debtor/Creditor relationships - the establishment of an exchange of goods. This is a contractual rather than moral relationship. The repayment of goods is central (it ignores revenge/remorse/guilt).

Now morality "comes in". A failure to meet the debt. What sanction is possible in this situation? If a debtor fails a debt then what can be done? The creditor wants repayment. N claims that the repayment of the debt is in allowing the creditor to exercise their cruelty on the debtor - getting their pound of flesh.

Then it gets entangled in bad conscience and guilt is inflicting cruelty on one's self for the failure to meet a demand.

### Still incomplete
But now we have an interesting animal that is self-critical and self-aware.

We still need to get to the character of the priest

The entanglement of bad conscience with religious interpretation and the emergence of MPS

The "Sovereign Individual"? - N's irony or N's ideal? Lecturer thinks it is more likely to be ideal. But there are respected arguments that present it as parody.
