N on truth and perspectivism

N scholars are bored about speaking about N & truth. "New Ns" claimed that N believed/claimed that there was no such thing as truth. This was a post-modernist interpretation. This view no longer tenable. But there is something about N's writings on truth that is potentially problematic

The falsification thesis. There are some cases where N seems to say that all sentences are false. Or an extreme protagorean relativist - true for me etc. Obvious problem of coherence of such views in general

Exegetical problem - what are we to make of N's own claims? What is the point of his writings?

There do seem to be some things N says that suggest there is no truth. The new N particularly fond of excerpt from "On Truth and a Lie in a Non-Moral Sense".

GS 265 

Facts are precisely what there is not, only interpretations WTP

There is a reliance on unpublished materials in making the claim that N believed there was no truth. These are often also taken uninterpreted. There is no evidence of the falsification thesis in N's last 6 published works. Their reading was part of the post-modern deconstructivist view and assumed that N was anti-science, anti-normative categories such as knowledge and other such opinions.

Our concepts are most likely to form coping and practical strategies for functional reasons rather than a perfect categorisation of the world's properties.

Truth a post hoc correspondence to physical realist facts. N thinks concepts are best explained as strategies to cope with the local environment as opposed to describing how the world is in itself. Eg the knowledge that water is H20 is useless to the drowning man. Such concepts need not latch onto the nature of the world independently of our experience/interests.

The sentence "there are chairs in the room" is false absent the human interests. There are physical objects with properties that lead us to categorise them as chairs. "Life no argument" GS 121. The fact that we successfully cope with the world is no argument that our concepts latch onto the nature of reality itself. 

Our conceptual repertoire equips us only to live in society? Can we really grasp anything deeper? How the world is in itself?

Abandonment of the Falsification thesis - no references in teh last 6 works. The abandonment of metaphysical realism. Moves towards a kind of idealism about the world. Noticed by M Clark - sequence in TotI - "How the True World Became a Fable"

Also Poellner's Nachlass Reconstruction. Not enough in published work to describe the transformation in N's thought.

When we talk about a thing it has to be trivially someting conceptualised by us. There's no concept-independent notion of a "thing" that we can start from. Any object is eseentially perspectival - depends not simply on the world but the particular perspective we adopt upon it.

We cannot conceive of the bare existence of the "absolute" object since we have no grasp of the concept of existence independent of our experience. N's empiricism. World identified with its appearance.

Perspectival Objectivity? GM III

Some (Schopenhauer) thought objectivity is about taking an independent impression of the world that is not perspectival. But N though concepts are determined by interests. Need not falsify but instead create difference views. Create more and more perspectives. Leiter's map analogy - asked to draw a map of oxford. Show us what Oxford is in itself. One way is to add interests/perspectives. Here is my local map that shows guitar and wine shops. Here is another map that shows Oxford toilets. Now we have a richer conception of Oxford.
