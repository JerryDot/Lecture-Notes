Ended last time with the image of the Christian selfless ideal (EH). N is very much concerned with this idea(l)

Now we are going to through the preface and identify what kind of project is contained within the GM. More tractable formulation of what N is concerned with

Sometimes translated as "On" the G of M, but Zur is better translated as "move towards" or "contribution toward". (Suggests that is how N viewed it - didn't consider it a final work. Shown that he referenced other texts. He also hoped that other universities might encourage further development). Wanted philosophers to investigate other fields such as physiolog, psychology. What are our distinctly human features in more tractable terms? Answered by considering them as animals.

## Preface I

Starts with:

>"We are unknown to ourselves, we knowers"

Project is about the origins of certain kinds of morality. In EH when talking about GM he says that the beginnings are quite deceptive. This opening statement will get unpacked later in the GM (without any explicit signposting). It will be somewhat of a surprise!

General thesis - the ideals of science spring from the same sources as the morality that GM will uncover

## Preface II

Brief autobiographical remarks about his thoughts concerning the "origins of moral prejudices". Metaphor of tree bearing fruit out of necessity. N = tree; fruit = thoughts. This is a biological, natural process - N thinks that this will be the right model for us. A good metaphor for understanding our thinking and our action (better than some appeal to Reason). There are natural processes that determine the kind of person you are and thus the kinds of thoughts you bear.

We are not rational free agents whose thoughts are determined by an impartial grasp of reason. We are bio creatures with environmentally determined thoughts

## Preface III

"What in fact, is the origin of our good and evil?"

N implies that earlier approaches involve appeals to something "behind" the world. Eg God approaches; Kantian ethics. For N any appeals to God are off the table - any form of theism is simply intellectually incredible "not our reasons but our tastes". He doesn't "argue" against the existence of god - he takes it as a premise.

Kantian - we live as an empirical self in a causal world; but we have a noumenal self that stands outside ordinary space and time. This is radically free and therefore capable of making all sorts of rational judgements. N thinks this is also implausible

WHAT DOES QUA MEAN (QUAY?)

He doesn't aim his philosophy at criticising religious people. The falsity of their views is not his concern - it is a premise. A Xian will not begin with N's starting point so he doesn't try to engage with them. He engages with fellow naturalists

"Under what conditions did man invent those value judgements good and evil?"

"And what value do [those judgements] themselves have?" - have they inhibited or furthered human flourishing until now?

GM is standardly read in two different ways. One answer's the latter question and the GM is a critique of the kinds of values discussed wherein. This is not the right reading! [Lecturer]

N says the GM is preparatory to the revaluation of values - are the values we have now the right ones?

## "Morality" and Morals

What is it that N is trying to explain? NOte that Morality can be distincted in a narrow and wider sense

Wide sense - any recognisable pattern of evaluation of kinds of human being/characters/actions. Ie that there is a normative dimension to a view of human beings. Many different kinds of substantive moralities in this sense - eg ethical code of mafia different from norms governing a Buddhist community. Many different sets of oughts that people can follow; many standards they can meet or fail. N recognises many moralities in this sense. Much of our action is guided by general normative framework. Compare humans to cats - humans can do things that they "should do" but cats just do? [Room for criticism here?]. Cat is governed by regularities or habits that prevent it from peeing indoors. This seems inconsistent. Unless it is how the being considers their action that is important?

Section in BGE called on the natural history of morals - wanted to show human variation with respect to the normative worlds in which you inhabit. Worth reading along with the GM. Certain moral philosophers take there to be a single moral standard. N wants to express that there are moralities. There is a particular set of normative standards that N is concerned with in the GM. He often calls this "Xian" morality. When he is spitting the word morality (rather than just stating) - he has a particular morality in mind - this Xian morality.

Note you don't have to be a Xian to follow Xian morality in N's terms. N finds growing forms of secularism in play without the recognition that the normative framework that modern human beings used is based in the Xian morality. Thinks that some of his fellow naturalists are advocating a morality that is inconsistent with their disbelief in Xianitiy - they have not thought through the implications. "They hate the Church but drink its poison" (paraphrase)

Leiter calls "morality in the perjorative sense" (MPS). Lecturer slightly disagrees but useful shorthand.

### Marks of MPS
N doesn't map out things neatly so the lecturer will for us!

* A metaphysical of freedom involving the Principle of Alternate Possibilties which underwrites the next poins This is a conception of agency and freedom. //Debate between compatibilism, free will. Intuition about being free that sits oddly with causal determinism. We could never have done otherwise given a certain situation. Eg clock cannot decide to go backwards. Intuition about moral that sits with reward and punishment. Why punish someone who could not have done otherwise? Does punishment have some alternate purpose/status.// N is not concerned with philosophical intuitions, but rather with how ordinary people think

* A notion of moral responsibility resting on desert and;

* Transparent motives and the assessment of intentions. "What we do is transparent to us", "we have authority over our actions", "my action is guided by an intention I have that is transparent to me". "Don't blame me, I was trying to be kind". You can be blamed for your intentions even if the actions end up alright. N thinks all this is false. Consciousness is a very shallow surface (argued by N). Most if not all of the causal determinants to your action are not apparent to your consciousness - a literal sense that you do not know what you are doing. Your drives push you in all sorts of directions and then you might have nice post hoc interpretations of what you were doing. Eg "I stopped asking you because I didn't want to bother you" but the real reason is that I did not want to keep getting rejected.

* A set of values centered on "selflessness" or asceticism. Chastity, poverty, humility are considered virtuous. These are all kinds of self-denial. Thinks these bleed into non-religious views as well and that it is core to the morality of the western world

* MPS is pro: altruism, modesty, peacefulness, extirpation of the instincts, pity and compassion for others

* MPS is against: indifference to suffering, acquistion of fortune and central of desire and its gratification

N thinks this has a secular version which is the kind of thing that governs western morality. Lots of evolutionary biology characterise morality as altruism. N wants to say that that is a very modern conception of what is central to morality. He thinks it is just the last outocme of Xianity in the Western world

Moving "beyond good and evil" is not the same as moving "beyond good and bad". Evil is about intention - doing harm. Linked to conception of the ideal person. The evil person is the one who is concerned with themself and producing suffering and accruing goods for themself. 

Doesn't mean that N thinks we should go beyond _any_ morality. He is not a nihilist - humans cannot help but live in a normative. But he thinks the ones we inherited are not the right ones.

## Preface IV

The "English" account of the origins of morality. Wants to explain how the MPS emerges. He is somewhat sceptical of previous accounts to explain the origins of morality - the "English" account. He is not picking out a nationality but a form of genealogy that N thinks has made certain types of mistakes.

Paul Ree and the History of Moral Sensations

## Preface VII

English have not done "real history" - they spare into the blue of speculation. Blue skies thinking. As opposed to the grey - what actually happened and what can be derived from it. English have failed to be grey - they speculate too much.

N thinks that the English genealogies are ahistorical -very abstract speculation over some basic concepts. "humans realised the utility of working together so they needed morality". N looks at characters to recognise that they have a different kind of morality. It is history relatively determinate when a certain Xian asceticism arose. English genealogies completely ignore this and talk about utility

English genealogies are insufficiently suspicious of "morality". This is a complex thing. Thinks that they bias their explanations in order to make sure that the values as they are now somehow have worthwhile origins. want their causative origins not to undermine their normative status. IF more critical then they would be more likely to see the difficulties in their emergence.

## What is the point of giving the GM

"There are absolutely no moral phenomena - only a moral interpretation of the phenomena" (BGE 108).

Moral "intuitions" reflect only our present concepts rather than reflecting timeless moral facts. We consider our intuitions against theory and settle into an equilibrium where the most intuitions are satisfied. Rawls.

They don't represent relatively solid facts around which the theory must be built but purely how we happen to think. Kant's groundwork starts with a set of intuitions about what the right thing to do in certain cases and then build from that. N wants to offer an explanatory account that those intuitions are contingent. Thus their status is dislodged. 

### Contingency and Giveness
"Morality itself ... was thought to be "given"... genuine problems ... that emerge from acomparison of many different moralities" (BGE)

Dislodge intuitive characterstic first. Now you can compare it with other intuitions and other kinds of alternative moralities.

## Qs
The explanatory account does not by itself undermine MPS. Allows us to see that those intuitions are historically contingent (rather than dependent on some timeless idea). Genetic fallacy!

Will lead on the "Slave revolt"
