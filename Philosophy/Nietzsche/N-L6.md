Genealogy is an account of the arising of MPS. Core of modern selflessness comes about in a certain way. Then there is the question of whether we want to continue with it? It has been destabilised by N's account but he hasn't yet directly argued against it

N is sceptical of MPS and is a self-styled immoralist. Unusually he tells us what this means at the end of EH. It is a negation of morality of benevolence/altruism and of a certain kind of ideal - that the morally perfect being is a selfless ascetic. Key exemplifier of this ideal is the crucifier. N offers himself as the contrast - Dionysus vs the crucifier. Not a free-for-all or nihilism.

"Morality as the danger of dangers" GM Preface 6 - this is how he regards MPS. There are resulting questions - to whom? what is the threat? how does it operate?

Two kinds of threat:

## The internalisation of MPS and the resulting disjointed self
To be looked at later

## The death of God and nihilism 
The sting in the tail of GM that the pursuit of truth leads to the downfall of the ascetic ideal and the resulting morality. Xian ideal in the West gave an overarching ideal/explanation for humanity. This is required in order for us to make sense of our existence and of suffering. Bad conscience and a need for meaning of suffering. The lack of an explanation causes more suffering. The more sophisticated one gets, the worse suffering becomes because of this.

# To Whom?

Potential "higher types" - those whose drives impose themselves on the world. Small number of persons. There are still masterly drives and those have a certain kind of creative potential. Objects, goals etc still have value. These people are the ones to whom morality possesses a threat. These are potential creators of certain kinds of ideals themselves that can stand in contrast to the ascetic ideal nad more importantly articulate a conception of human beings that makes sense of the suffering and allows the human animal to exist in a morally tolerable/evaluatively good state.

Early in N's writings he was focussed on higher types. Felt that they were needed to create works that would lead to a culture that could revaluate values. (Wagner and N eg the festival thingy). Higher types are almost instrumental here as they create culture that has an evaluative trickle-down effect.

Later on he loses interest in most of humanity - doesn't care about the trickle-down anymore. His focus is with the well-being of the higher types full stop. For most people the Xian story will continue and they are happy to live in that world - so they don't need Wagners etc. "The ideas of the herd should rule in the herd but not reach beyond it".

## Death of God and Nihilism
BGE 55 and the final stage of cruelty. Remember all of culture is based on the deepening and spirituality of cruelty. Natural propensities and negative evaluative. Cruelty is directed inwards and results in bad conscience etc. This is painful but creative - becomes a create that becomes self-evaluating and therefore a creature with a capacity for norms and ideals. You can be motivated by the possibility of failing an internally-held ideal.

This has unfortunately led to the death of God via ascetic ideal and pursuit of truth.

The Madman and the Death of God (GS 125). Describes a madman coming down from a mountain to proclaim that god is dead and we have killed him. Madman is laughed at by his fellows - modern people that had no need of this belief anymore. They do not recognise that they continue with the morality that they have but do not realise that the underpinning has disappeared. Eg Schopenhauer (altruistic atheist). That seems fine until the madman points out that they have not yet seen the implications.

The few prone to such nihilism - the suffering they go through has no meaning or explanatory story. That is what he is worried about when considering the consequences of the madman. But possible source of counter-deal?

## The threat outlined

Internalising MPS prevents the higher types from fully embracing their privilieged nature and position.

Without MPS they are are such that they could have embraced themselves in good conscience and "overcome" themselves. IE could accept their nature for what it is through evaluative interpretation. (This only applies to some masterly individuals).

N trying to distance this select type from the kinds of evaluative categories in Western morality (that would cause them to fail to pursue the things that they are born to do).

The unfortunate as "poisoning the conscience of the fortunate with their own misery ... so that they will be ashamed of their good fortune" GMM III 14

EA and Singer; Geldof demanding giving money at Live Aid etc. N not concerned with those philosophical conditions. He is interested in culture's effects on people's philosophy/psychology.

Some would say that N is strawmanning these positions but this misses the point. The point is not the subtlety - the point is the more vaguely articulated cultural atmosphere where those commands are made. Not many will hear the subtlety of Singer. N wants to dislodge the hold (not in a subtle philosophical method with procs and cons) because of the cultural effect. This is part of the reason that he wrote as he did - his writing is effectively charged because he is trying to add to the cultural environment a different number of causal levels to shift the higher types away from MPS/some of culture's impacts on their morality.

N predicts that there will be: more concern about animal suffering; locus of value will be the preponderance of pleasure over pain (which N despised as it is the lowest possible level of value); people like Bob Geldof.

Why is all this a concern? Goes much deeper than just not wanting Kubrick to feel bad about his treatment of actors. Is about a more fundamental concern related to the naturalism claim. Human beings are more related to nature under N's view.

N shares a lot of stuff with David Hume including a rejection of substantial selves. Anything we call a self is a group of organised drives - compare to Hume's republic and commonwealth of perceptions. 

Therefore reject the substantial "I" that is the possessor and controller of out mental states. Also reject the resulting traditional normative claim that "Reason ideally should control 'lower' elements (drives, desires)".

N and the grammar of "I" - that leads to the implicit belief that an "I" exists that exhibits agency.

N does not give a direct argument for the claim that there is no self but a number of drives. There is just the indirect naturalist approach. We are continuous with nature and therefore must be built out of simpler systems like those that lead to plant growth. There is no reason to think that we are anything different. Also involves a kind of rejection of genuine "freedom". We would want a self to be a locus of responsibility but we don't have this causa sui - no "controlling centre".

Instead N suggests we should think of the self as a hierachy of drives. Often pulled in different directions. N thinks we should consider coordinated action that we do perform as a single drive coopting and organising other drives. My desire to read a book is a drive that displaces other drives to watch cricket etc. Anything to do with "Reason" is merely instrumental and perhaps in a backseat to competing desires.

So left with a different conception - a person is a bundle/hierachy of drives etc. But there is another odd thing with N - he asserts that there are very few "people". In Z he dramatically describes Zarathustra as walking through a collection of fragments of people. Makes this claim to distinguish between a descriptive and normative sense of a "person". To be a person in this conception is to be a collection of well-integrated and organised drives. Therefore very few persons as a "genuine individual" is one with fully-integrated drives. Where each and every disposition works towards a certain goal. In this conception Kubrick might be close to a genuine person.

This brings us to N's ideal of self-creation. What does your conscience say? - "You should become what you are" GS 270. Constantly talking about this idea(l). EH "Why I am so Clever" - how one should become what one is. There is a worry (Leiter) that all of this talk of self-creation is nonsensical as N thinks there are no selves- just collections of drives. So there is no one thing that does the creating. But Leiter has put the emphasis in the wrong place - there is not a self doing a creating - there are the contingent circumstances that lead to a collection of drives converging/integrating towards a particular end. This is N's conception of freedom.

The values of MPS are blocks on the existence of fully realised persons who are the ones with singular foci. Those are going to be the creators of value.
