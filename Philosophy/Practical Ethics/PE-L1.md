Methodology for doing practical ethics?

One approach is to choose an ethical theory (a task in normative theory) and apply it to particular problematic cases. Eg Consider the distinction between consequentialism and non-consequentialism.

One might adopt a consequentialist theory and consider a range of problems applying the basic principles of the theory. Eg Singer's Practical Ethics.

Or could consider a different approach eg a duty-based non-consequentialist system, where we have duties of beneficence, special care, honesty, to other species

**Alternative approach** is to treat each moral problem in isolation as much as possible without assuming theoretical decisions in normative theory. This has some strong limitations as it is sometimes impossible to judge certain cases without more general moral implications.

Eg distinction between doing harm and allowing harm; distinction between intending harm and acting in a way in which we can foresee harm.

We'll cover abortion & reproductive ethics, euthanasia, treatment of animals, demands of affluence, inter-generational issues.

## Abortion and reproductive ethics
Why is this a good place to start? As a matter of fact it has been the focus of many debates in practical ethics (so purely contigent that there is a lot of trodden ground). Also very rich philosophically. Links to the value of life, moral status, right to life, right to bodily integrity and the metaphysics of personhood.

Reproductive ethics is concerned with questions around reproduction and beginning-of-life issues such as contraception, technologies, surrogacy, abortion.

Is abortion morally permissible? In practical ethics we are not asking about policy or legislation - we are not asking if abortion should be legal. This irks me - every discussion about it is on some level political. The permissibility question is also obviously not the only moral question about abortion.

The philosophical controversy can be summarised as:

* There are people who think that the foetus is a person and killing a person is never morally permissible
* Those who think that either the foetus is not a person or that killing a person is sometimes morally permissible or that having an abortion is not always an act of intentional killing

Positions:
* A Abortion is never morally permissible
* B Abortion is sometimes morally permissible
* C Abortion is always morally permissible

## A) Never
An interesting question for A is: _if abortion is never morally permissible because it violates some right X, then what are some other acts which are never morally permissible because they violate X?_

A might be in trouble if its supporters cannot adequately answer that question

## B) Sometimes
Often defended by responding to arguments in support of A. Even if you hold that sometimes abortion is permissible then there are still questions around at what point it ceases to be permissible etc. 

Other considerations focus on effects of pregnancy to the woman/bodily autonomy and its cause

## C) Always
If abortion is always morally permissible then what other acts are morally permissible? Particularly related to what other acts of killing/letting die can be allowed? Can be linked to infanticide, euthanasia, treatment of animals etc.

## Arguments

Main argument for A (and its variants):

1) Abortion kills a foetus

2) A foetus is a person

2*) A foetus is innocent (and include innocence in future lines)

2') A foetus is a human being (and use human being from then on)

3) Abortion involves killing a person

4) Killing a person is never morally permissible (since it is murder)

4') Human beings have a right to life

5') Killing a being with a right to life is a violation of a moral right

6') Violation of a moral right is never morally permissible

Conclusion - abortion is never morally permissible. The introduction of innocence in * makes the position more consistent when confronted with related issues eg capital punishment.

"Killing and letting die" response - could point out that sometimes it involves letting the foetus die rather than killing. Also notice that the pregnant woman is not the active killer so undergoing it may be permissible. Also might be a consequence of DDE or something similar

Is this foetus a person? The standard argument against abortion assumes the affirmative. In some views a person = a human being (biological approach to personal identity). On this view then sure it is a person. Therefore if persons have moral status then so does the foetus.

In other views a person and a human being are not the same thing. Some persons may be non-human and some humans may fail to be persons. The psychological approach has some psychological characteristics to qualify as a person. Eg capable of having mental states, conscious experiences, self-consciousness, memories, concept of self etc. On these views the foetus is a human being but not a person as it does not have required properties.

Is the foetus a potential person? Might be used by proponents of A. But does the main argument for A work if the foetus is only a potential person? Do potential persons have rights that persons have? Does a potential PM have the same rights that an actual Prime Minister has? Maybe the right to life is special or show that there are other reasons why it is wrong to abort.
