From where does patriachy emerge? Obvious resistance to it being determined by biology. 

Everyone comes from a womb - Adrienne Rich _Of Woman Born_. Does women's subordination come from men's deep horror of being dependent on women for birth, reproduction and care. This threatens men's views of being powerful individuals and independent. Rich's views developed when introduced to new ideas (she likely would have had something interesting to say from a trans-inclusive point of view).

On one level motherhood is a political institution - exonerates men from fatherhood and creates a schism between public and private life. Calcifies human choices and potentialities. Alienates women from their bodies by incarcerating them in them.

Obvious start would be equal childrearing/care. This for her was the highest priority if looking to make a change in this regard. Why would this be so revolutionary? Such a shift would change the expectations of children (and therefore men, it would also change the entire community's relationship to childhood).

Women also need to change how they deal with adult men in their lives - need to expect them to behave like equals with regard to childcare (not praising for the slightest effort etc). Need to refuse them the traditional separation between "love" and "work".

### The Dialectic of Sex 1970
Dialectic materialist account of male supremacy. Comparable to a marxist account of economy but in the area of sexual relations rather than class.

Patriachy insisted as a natural phenomenon here. Women are naturally biologically inferior because they have the worse situation for sexual production. They are subject to the tyranny of their own biology. This is unlike economic class as this springs directly from a biological reality which is an inherently unequal power distribution.

Firestone's crucial point is that what is natural need not be good or necessary. Humanity has begin to outgrow nature and we can no longer justify the maintenance of a discriminatory sex class system on the grounds of its natural origin. Therefore a sexual revolution is required - as radical as Marx's or maybe more so. End goal would be to eliminate the sex distinction itself - genital differences should no longer matter culturally.

Can the "sexual state" be modelled similarly to Marx's economics state? Do models such as abdication potentially parallel here?

For Rich it is men's unconscious relationship to women but for Firestone it is raw relations based on biological sex differences. Both have a lot in common however - insisting that women should have full access to control over their body and sexual health etc. Universalising the condition of women - being responsible for reproduction is crucial to freeing all of humanity.

Marx and Engels - the "latent slavery in the family, though still very crude is the first property". But there is a contradiction - patriachy is an effect of capitalism in Marx's account afterwards but must have been brought about before capitalism. Seems like capitalism and patriachy are not directly dependent or causal to each other. But there are reasons to believe that they are related or support each other. Eisenstein 1977.

Federici 1975 - the reproductive labour typically produced by working-class women such as caring for children is an indispensable feature of capitalism. Without this there would be noone to feed capitalist workers or develop children. Some people wanted this to be recognised with a wage. This would require the work to be regarded. In some sense this wasn't just a demand for money but a demand for recognition and a societal gestalltshift.

In some insidious and implicit way capitalism shows violence with regard to housework - it is transformed into a natural attribute of female character and is described as an act of love that does not deserve a wage. It is manipulative and unfair in some way.

Wanting wages for housework is "the first step towards refusing to do it, because the demand for a wage makes our work visible, which is the most indispensable condition to begin to struggle against it..."

Therefore the request for a wage is partly a means towards the end of abolitioning the sexual inequality in "housework". Women's unwaged labour is a necessary condition in the background of the capitalist system. It would be to capitalism's detriment for this work to go undone. 

Is there some break-down between a societal analysis and an individual analysis here?

Fraser 2014 - "commodification is far from universal in capitalist society." The family would be a "non-commodified zone". Some might view it as an escape from capitalism. To argue for wages is to accept the full capitalist commodification of the whole world. Read the whole quote!

Where the foreground and background categories/ares collide we have interesting disputes. Eg is education a commodity? Gment says yes. Is it ok to rent out wombs? Some describe neoliberalism as the expansion of capitalist logic into background areas

Where does sex fall? Is it implicitly commodified due to the existence of prostitutes?

Read _Revolting Prostitutes_ 2018. Just because something is criminalised, doesn't mean it doesn't still happen. For them criminalising sex work does not simply remove the problem - there will always be people that will do it. Sex work is work - naming it as work establishes the commodity nature and that it may be consistent with capitalism - to argue against it will require a different argument.

Argue that there is no way to punish the men involved in sex work without also punishing the women involved as well. These are also some of the most vulnerable women so this is not preferable in general.
