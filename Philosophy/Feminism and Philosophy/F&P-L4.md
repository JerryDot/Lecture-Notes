Sex, Sexuality and Sexual Liberation

How does the gender system begin? How/why is it divided into two and then listed in a hierachy.

How did this come to be seen as "natural", "necessary"

One answer eg according to Hartsock is to identify the origin of gender in biological sex and its links to the biology of sexual reproduction.

Others find it as a need to define themselves psychologically in opposition to the "other"

For MacKinnon it is a product of sex (not in biological category but as the activity). The humans that are male can acquire access to other human bodies (female) to gain sexual goods.

Relation to dominance/submission in sexual relations and its social meaning. This lends itself to the feminist view of sexual equality. The sexual objectification and exploitation of women by men. Looks primarily at hetero views of sex.

MacKinnon wants us to reject the Freudian "common-sense" view of sex. Wants to return to a natural view that is repressed by civilisation. Pre-political an unoppressed. Sex is a fully political construction shielding itself as natural and pre-political itself.

Under patriachy this construction of sex is itself an instrument of sexual violence. What conceptions of sexuality exist outside patriachy.

How is this consistent with women's consensual experiences under patriachy. MacKinnon finds pleasure and consent as symptoms of the problem. Sometimes it is in some sense transactional and this is the meaning of being a victim. They consent because it is one way to exercise power in a situation where they have little.

To seek pleasure out, or to seek subordination is again a simulacrum of attaining real power. These can be seen as coping mechanisms in the face of reality.

"As if women under male supremacy have power to [negotiate]..."

What then do women need/want from sex? There may be no decisive escape from the status quo. It may be that sexuality is so gender marked that it carries dominance and submission with it; no matter the gender of its participants.

This does not mean that there is no unproblematic sex under patriachy. Rape Redefined 2016. Not all sex acts are equally bad. With conscious work it is possible to get closer. Doomed to seem complicated or out of reach. The sex most free from politics can seem the most political.

Willis 1981 worth reading. Became the origins of pro-sex feminism

She sets the case against the MacKinnonite argument. By reinforcing the neo-Victorian ideas that women are forced into sex and don't really desire it, then they have overreached. This position results in oppression of women's desires itself.

Intersectionality has helped guide feminism towards not prescribing universal advice/rules. This turn has also made feminists uncomfortable thinking in terms of false consciousness - how should feminists regard non-feminist women living under patriachy.

One approach is to take women at their word. If they claim to enjoy working in pornography or sub-sex play then we are required to trust their claims/beliefs/experiences. This is primarily an ethical claim. A feminism that trades too freely in skeptical dominance views ends up undermining itself or making the goal unattainable.

Sex is merely wanted or unwanted - not coerced or dominated. Compare to Marx's critique of the free marketplace. Seems a powerful exercise.

Feminism finds itself questioning the liberalist view of private vs public in a very important way. More Willis quotes.

"What would we choose if we had a real choice?" This is a reversal on Willis's part. Do we have fixed points or can we change our views/beliefs etc. What are women's sexual choices today and shall we take them at face value? What would women's sexual choices be in a more free environment?

Therefore the views of feminism on these two issues must be nuanced and take both into account.

Pro-all-sex seems to be able to go too far in validating pre-existing but problematic scenarios. The flip side seems to deny current women's autonomy and experiences.

Bartky:

Male supremacy is not only forced openly but also covertly through the manipulation of desire. This need not require force, fraud or the violation of any rights. As a consequence, some women might be lead by such methods to engage in sexual acts that reinforce patriachy. Might worry that this weakens the notion of "consent" - can one consent properly under patriachy?

Also suggests that trying to enforce a strict sexual code is also not the answer as sexuality is "mysterious and opaque, seemingly unalterable because its meaning is impenetrable"

View all experiences and think carefully before mandating for all people (obvious consequence of intersectionality).

Think of the ways that bodies can be ranked under sexual desirability. Thin, white, cis, able-bodied women regarded as higher on the hierachy. This is also a political fact from the intersectional approach.

But sex-positive aims seem to suggest that this might be ok? People should be able to have their own sexual preferences right?? But are these also influenced by powerful beauty standards.

Online dating seems to have concentrated some of the problems with this system. Dealbreakers and the vast inequality against people who do not represent beauty standards.

Some of these problems are most intensely felt by trans-women "cotton ceiling". Describes the lack of access to what noone is required to give - sex. There is no entitlement to sex or sexual desire. Personal preferences are not merely personal - to some extent they are political (second wave)

Andrea Chu 2018 - the trans-experience exposes not the nature of identity but the force of. "we rarely want the things we should"

But this reinforces the anti-trans case that trans people do not want to be the other gender - they just want the trappings.

Marginalised men talk of entitlement; marginalised women talk of empowerment.

Black/big is beautiful are proposals for the revaluation of values. A redefinition of beauty standards. This isn't an objective issue but a personal one. Trying to trigger a gestalltshift (check spelling because that is definitely wrong).

Take the question seriously and we are lead to the idea that sexual desire is not immutable.

Not trying to discipine desire but to consider desire freed from the binds of injustice and unfair/unnecessary demands.

Rich 1980 - heterosexuality is to some extent political. She is pointing out to us the diverse unseen mechanisms that instruct the pathways and shape our desires. Behind the scenes is a political force.

Think of "born this way" as a force for homosexual revolution. This innateness grates or stands in tension with some constructivist tendencies of feminism. Can also be in tension with people's experiences.

Controversial to say that being gay is a choice - can play into the hands of anti-gay crusaders. But is it not also valid(?)

Questions for each of us to answer about the shapes of our own desires and relationships.
