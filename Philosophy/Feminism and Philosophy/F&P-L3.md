Central point of intersectionality was that any feminist analysis that does not attend to relationships between sexism and other oppression issues is an analysis that will ignore the very worst-off women. This raises important questions for feminist solidarity. Truly intersectional politics suggests we must give up politics as a "home". 

Joining this kind of politics for the first time can feel like "coming home" which makes this contradiction very painful. Maybe there is no radical politics without some kind of personal experience between the individual and the group.

Heidigger on homelessness - the impossibility of finding ourselves permanently at home is only a problem when we do not give thought to it. It is part of our essential humanity and thus is not a problem but an aspect of reality.

What difference does difference make when it comes to what we know

# Feminist Epistemology 
In what ways is women's experience of oppression advantageous? In what ways is the experience of men under patriachy disadvantageous in the ways that it leaves men blind to the systems of oppression and any correlary features.

Consciousness as oppositional - Hegel. A crucial point is when consciousness becomes self-consciousness. These two creatures engage in a fight to the death until one admits defeat.

According to Hegel it is the slave and not the master who goes on to believe in full consciousness. The slave is in connection and full confrontation with the reality. Also they must understand the master better than the master understands himself. The master alienates himself from full reality and is not fully free as long as he depends on the slave.

Standpoint Theory

People in the subordinate social position are the ones possible of gaining full consciousness with respect to race, class etc. Therefore ultimately from Marx that we get the original standpoint - the proletarian standpoint. Based on the dialectical experience of the proletariat vs the bourgeouisie. Similar to the master-slave dialectic.

Thus also positioned to notice the full nature of the wage relationship. Marx describes entering into the hidden abode of production - what is really happening in the negotiation between worker and property owner. He discovers the occluded workings of capitalism

Marx describes a transformation in how we see capitalistic exchange works. Workers sell their labour in a fair consensual exchange. Therefore the marketplace is a paradise of freedom. But in reality it looks like a master-slave relationship as the work does not own the means of production. He/she sells themself as a good in order to benefit the master. To see the world in this way is to take the proletarian standpoint. Marx even points out that many members of the working-class buy into the story of capitalism. 

Marx holds the proletariat standpoint to be something to be achieved via philosophical reflection or by political action. The proletarian standpoint is not on the same standpoint epistemologically as the capitalist standpoint. The way that Marx's epistemology differs from standard epistemology because it does not believe that all social/economics positions are equally good starting points for the foundation.

Marx takes the perspective of the proletariat.

1983 Hartsock: "The Feminist Standpoint..."
Womens' lives make available a particular and privilieged view point on male supremacy. Women responsible for clothing, caring for and birthing the labourers. Working class produces the things purchased by society. It is women that reproduce society by themselves. Nothing innate about women that gives them this standpoint but it is the social position that they are assigned. Things are seen in terms of their use value rather than in terms of their exchange value.

Maybe this gives us the view to see what is really important - the satisfaction of human need and the sustenance of human community (over acquisition of goods or sexual conquest)

Capitalism depends on women's labour even while devaluing it etc. Also goes further to devalue love

Hartsock does not believe the existence of the feminist standpoint does not necessarily mean all women will get there. It is an achievement (Like Marx's view for the proletarian standpoint). The social condition itself involves the internalising of male superiority so it is not generally achievable and women may become instruments of the patriachy itself.

Therefore it does not give individual women ultimate responsibility or authority for their lives. Standpoint epistemology does not always entail yielding to the lived experience of others as not all will be lead to the same epistemology.

The point for both of them is about how reflecting on a social thing can lead to a new form of consciousness. Such an inquiry must begin with the lived experiences of those living under oppression but it does not end there.

A standpoint requires not just to be heard and seen but also to reach for a new unimagined world. Not all social positions are created equal. SE rejects the common opinion according to which anyone can know the moral truths regardless of where they find themselves postioned within society. It claims that such efforts are not always rewarded with knowledge. May not be possible with logic and reflection alone. Some people are so entrenched in their conditions that they cannot understand. THey need gestallshift to have a chance of understanding it.

SE is therefore an anti-liberal epistemology (but not necessarily reactionary as a result). Claims that it is the best way to get to an objective truth (even though it does not inherently favour one view over another). Might be impossible for someone who does not consider their race/gender important to see sexual harassment as an issue. To intuit its inherent wrongness you already need to live in a feminist-affected standpoint. Therefore SE is somewhat required to get to an objective truth.

Hartsock worries that she is assuming too much commonality amongst women's experience. Have to ground women's epistemic privilieged in their ...

Eg for Marx the proletariat are defined by their relation to the means of production. How do we define women in an analogous way?

Can SE go beyond the confines of Western culture? 

Uma Narayan "The Project of Feminist Epistemology..."

Black women's knowledge is "subjugated knowledge". Etc from Patricia Hill Collins. White people do not need to understand black people. But black women need to understand the white social world more than white people do. _Black Feminist Thought_ 1990

Eg Jefferson had children with Sally Hemmings. This was claimed for a long time. But Public opinion was White opinion where they deferred to the accounts of Jefferson's white descendants.

The claim is that there is knowledge but dominant practices are often inadequate when it comes to arriving at knowledge. Other standpoints can provide ways to find these inadequacies. (It is not claimed that feminist or other standpoints supercede regular epistemology).

How does this discussion relate to the internalistic vs externalist debate. Crucial debates was whether epistemology can depend on processes that agents themselves do not have access to. Internalism may seem to be related to a theory of epistemology that supports those with social power/priviliege

IF certain social positions come with certain epistemic advantage then the convers is that some positions have a disadvantage. _White Ignorance_ - Charles Mills. Wanted to pin down a way in which white racism plays a causal role in white people's knowledge/ignorance. White priviliege is therefore somewhat structurally related to white supremacy. Also white people do not need to know certain things - eg how to appear unthreatening to white cops or how to navigate the racist criminal justice system. Might also assign themselves too much credibility and not to others. Epistemic laziness because one ie privilieged. Closemindedness - not wanting to find out about things that are inconvenient

Produced and sustained by the deep habits of condition, society etc that are shaped by the politics of racist/sexist subordination etc. White people are more likely to identify an indistinct image as a gun if they have been primed with a black face rather than a white face. This fact is chilling when linked to police killings.

The availability of heuristics such as thug, slut, whore etc ensure that white males see things in a certain moral light. Lays the groundwork for racist and sexist belief.

Which parts of social history are remembered and memorialised? This predetermines what beliefs and thoughts we will embark on. Eg the resistance in oxford to grapple with its history of slavery etc.

The political philosophy (Rawls) of the last 50 years makes no reference to racism sexism etc - it starts in a ideal fair society. It has nothing to say about how to get to the ideal world from a corrup non-ideal world. Political philosophy itself is therefore a construction of white priviliege. Undoing white ignorance; male ignorance is a matter of transforming our ways of seeing, recording, broadcasting information etc

Warning:

Very easy when talking about the epistemic advantages of the oppressed to paint an overly romantic view. Oppressed people are excluded from institutions where knowledge is created and disseminated. Even if they do have access they often get less respect or credit and may in the worst cases come to see themselves in the same way.

Sometimes oppression means not even having the words available to describe what is happening/has happened to you. 

The creation of the term sexual harrassment - makes it slightly easier to make sense of what the situation is. This is an example of the feminist standpoint in action. We can celebrate these moments but also remember the past women who have not benefitted from these. We must also consider the women who have the right words and concepts but to whom noone will listen.
