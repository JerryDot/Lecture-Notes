Last week included perspective of MAcKinnon about sex etc

# Pornography
Both an expression and a tool of male sexual supremacy. Symbolic of male sexual supermacy and part of a cultural and political war. It was a focal point for this struggle. Group came together - advert SNUFF The film that could only be made in South America... where LIFE IS CHEAP. LA goroup of women came together and produced advert - "I'm Black and Blue from The Rolling Stones and I love it!" _this is a crime against women_. This group expanded in the US and UK etc

Some groups differed in how they felt pornography should be censored or restricted by the law? Is it a violation of free speech/expression? If censorship is not an option then how can we influence it?

MacKinnon and Dworkin wanted pornography to be about equality and freedom - not the explicit subordination of women.

At the time Deep Throat was seen as an emancipatory act - not how it is viewed today... Hopefully that is a measure of progress.

Later Linda Lovelace told story of how she was forced into sexual exploitation and was coerced. Made statement with MacKinnon and Dworkin (who had made feminist critiques of the film). Statute of limitations had run out. They did consider how to use civil law to curb pornography. 

They argued that pornography was a form of sexual discrimination. This would render victims able to obtain compensation for their coersion. Also would institute an obvious link between pornography and sexual violence. They drafted a General ordinance that was vetoed by the mayor after passing votes. One time a similar law was struck down as unconstitutional.

Opinion was that they agreed that pornography contributes to the subordination of women as free speech trumps it. Judge Easterbrook's writing - pornography as speech. Canada extended the law to remove violence in pornography (criminal law). They used the justification that MacK and D had tried to use the US.

There was pushback from libertarians, ACLU etc. There was also pushback from pro-sex feminists. They saw this as part of an anti-sex feminist that endorsed the Victorian norms and rejected women's agency.

Note that anti-obscenity laws could backfire. A pro-feminist bookstore was shut down while an adult video franchise opened 20 new stores. Should be careful about criminalising women's sexual agency. Consider how TERFs play into the hands of those who would also inhibit their rights.

Porn world of the past is not the same that exists today. The porn wars of the past still exist to some extent at the level of theory when describing today's version.

There is a letter war between Dworkin and someone else that is worth checking out. By definition pornography was not just the depiction of subordination but the act of it. Can the depiction of a violent act be an act of violence? Were they guilty of a philosophical error and a sleight of hand? This is in the context of a free society where free speech is regarded highly and cannot be impinged upon. Therefore it is important to make it an act rather than a speech.

Rae Langton tries to justify the theory of pornography as an act. She did this by looking at speech theory. To say something is to do something - speech acts. To say a promise is also to promise - it is something between speech and an act. To warn someone is a speech act, and we can look further for marrying, etc.

This doesn't apply to things like "I insult you" or "I have convinced you". Does apply to things like "I resign". A speech act is something you can perform simply by saying something. But speech acts are not solely constituted by the speech component. To promise someone something is to inform them of your promise and simultaneously make a personal commitment to meet it.

Three dimensions - the locutionary dimension - what the speech literally means. The illocutionary dimension - why the person is doing by saying it. The perlocutionary dimension - the causal effects of the speech act.

Eg "Smoking is dangerous to your health" -- you are warned -- you react by stopping smoking

Langton makes you think of the discrimination in an apartheid state. This is a combination of "speech acts". They implicitly rank the races etc from what they say/state. Multiple speech acts involved in the sentence "black people are not eligible to vote". The legislature saying that sentence makes it so. Is invested in political authority/depends upon it. (If I had gone to the street and said the contrary it would have had no effect)

Can pornography implicitly be linked in the same way as apartheid? If so then where does the authority to perform such a speech act come from?

Let's take for granted the locutionary dimension that porn is the subordination of women. The perlocutionary is the effects. Is there an illocutionary dimension? Plausibly yes - it ranks women as inferior to men where they are sex objects. Default beauty standards imposed by directors etc. This leads to women being incapable of saying no to sex.

Porn creates conditions where women can try to refuse but are not believed(?) Read Langton!

Whatever authority porn has seems to come from whatever power it has to influence the people who watch it to believe that it represents "real sex". Is porn authoritative in the domain of speech about sex? Coy et al 2013

Distinctions between illocution and perlocution are interesting. Is there overlap with sub-_____ meaning and speech that I remember from somewhere else?

Internet has made "authority"/"influence" change in nature drastically because of the abundance of ability to transmit information.

Who is responsible for the subordination of women by pornography? Bauer. Is it the producers? Is it the consumers? etc

Not a terribly straightforward explanation of how pornography should be considered as a speech act. Speech acts seems to be inconsistently regarded. Holding people accountable for them seems to be inconsistently implemented.

MacKinnon 1993 Only Words:

> social life is full of words that are legally treated as the acts they constitute without so much as a whimper from the First Amendment. What becomes interesting is when the First Amendment frame is invoked and when it is not.

Why is it that the graphic subordination of women for men's sexual gratification not considered an act of sexual discrimination? 

Answer - the law is male institution made for men. So it treats women from the men's interests and pretends to be genderless.

We clearly need to have some alternative means of sex education than this. Deciding what sex should be requires some mediation of the ways in which sex is seen today. Might require some kind of negative truth - needs to remove a lot of the existing tropes etc and try to see it again for the first time from a non-oppressive situation
