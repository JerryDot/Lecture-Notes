Being and Nothingness 

## Life sketch of Sartre (some philosophy will feature)

b 1905 in Paris. Met de Beauvoir 1929 at ecole superior. He was convinced that phenomenology was better as it allowed him to describe objects through experiences and thereby extract philosophy. By-passes the antithesis of idealism and realism. Affirms the supremacy of reason and the reality of the sense-ible world.

For Sartre philosophy resolves questions by achieveing a deep intuitive familiarity with the problem field. Description - not argumentation is the primary philosophical field. Everything is used to obtain the intuition which is the means by which philosophy is done. Need to read Wittgenstein to see whether this approach is different or whether it is just an evolutionary hand-waving that gets us to W.

Therefore philosophy attends to appearances or phenomena. A phenomenon does not point to anything behind it - an action points to itself; not to some hidden reality.

Heidegger  - the only thing that should be examined is beings. Therefore a central conern of sartrean phenomenology is the question of being.

Being is disclosed to use through some immediate means eg boredom nausea, and then ontology is the description of the phenomenon of being as it manifests itself without intermediary.

1940 studied Heidegger while a PoW in Germany. B&N published in 1943. 1960 - criticism of dialectic of reason but did not have massive academic effect. Refused Nobel Prize 1964

Adopted the Letter on Humanism and gave a lecture that existentialism is humanism. One of the central figures in the existentialist movement

## S's existentialism

Influenced by N's work undermining traditional morality.

Influenced by Heidegger's claim that the essence of human being lies in its existence - we are not defined by fixed properties but by the conception of self and possibility in the context of being a human being

Not clear whether S misconstrues or repurposes. But S means something different when he says this.

### Traditional Being vs Existence

Essence vs Existence. Being involves both essence (what a thing is) nad existence )that in virtue of which a particular concrete thing is present. The essence of a samurai can be considered in the absence of current samurais. Like an uninstantiated class.

Sartre deliberately messes with this

For H "being" = being in general (covering a multiplicity of different modes of beings including what-being and that being [ essentia and existentia] ). Modes of being include Dasein, the available, the occurent, life, numbers etc.

H says essence lies in existence - always ahead of itself and projecting onto possibilities. To always see yourself in terms of possibilities.

Might look like Sartre also draws a distinction similarly between being and existence but he does not. In Nausea p127. Being is experience and existence. All concepts or abstract categories lose their teeth. Being is what it is. p175

Man only defines himself after comnig into existence. Not only is man wat he conceives imself to be but he is also only what he wills himself to be (Existentialism is a Humanism). Cross between N and H.

## Features of Existential Philosophy
Concern with providing a description of human existence and world without the distortion of scientific presuppositions that reveals the world as it is. To understand what it is to be human we must be ebyond causal scientific explanation

Heightened awareness of the non-rational dimensions of human existence eg habits, non-conscious moods etc.

Questioning the degree to wich the world is cut to the measure of our intellect. A will to consider that our current concepts and categories fail to capture the world as it actually presents itself to us. This is why this fits so well with phenonmenology.

Belief that what it is to be human cannot be reduced to any set of features. To be human is to transcend facticity. (Why not to be is to transcend? Speciesist?)

## Existentialist doctrines
Everyday life is at best banal and at worst absurd and meaningless

Anxiety in the face of death can disclose this to us - there is a constant motivation to flee from the anxiety of these topics back to conformism and a reaffirmation of everyday life.

The most pressing philosophical task is to help us cope with this anxiety that allows us to affirm this life in all its absurdity

The ideal human life is authentic - it accepts responsibility for the exercise of freedom in discovering and realising who you are.

## Key Concepts
Consciousness: positional vs non-positional

The being of the prereflective cogito and the being of the phenomenon. But we must still explain how these can be placed under the same heading. Looks like duality though?? (25/26). Consciousness observes other objects and does not posit transcendental objects.

Thetic consciousness - sets before itself an object of which it is focally aware.

Non-positional consciousness is aware of something "on the fringes" of consciousness - ie what is not present as an object or the focus of its thoughts. Eg p11 - counting cigarettes. Read to understand. Background of perception is something we are not positionally aware of.

A non-positional awareness of myself is not the same as a reflective consciousness of myself. Sartre thinks we must avoid an infinite regress of being aware of yourself being aware of something.
