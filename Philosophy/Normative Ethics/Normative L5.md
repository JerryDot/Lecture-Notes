# Equality

All other things being equal, is there a reason to prefer a uniform distribution of total lifetime well-being or an unequal distribution? Utilitarians typically want to maximise total welfare (or average welfare etc) - on this view the two possibilities are equally good.

Does this view change at some point between complete equality and rampant inequality? Note that we are measuring welfares so we could already be taking into account any effects of inequality. Maybe it leads to the thought experiment where we should want society to be set up such that we would accept it if we knew that we'd join at a random place.

Maybe this distribution question poses a challenge for utilitarianism. At the extreme it looks like a utility monster.

You might be attracted to some kind of egalitarianism but some philosophers regard it as implausible. Alternatives such as prioritarianism or sufficientarism might be better ideas.

Why might we argue for or against any of these

## Varieties of Egalitarianism
**Telic Egalitarianism** - it is in itself bad if some people are undeservedly worse off than others (Temkin 2003). We could unfair inequality as "worse" and a bad by itself.

Here Equality is _intrinsically good_. There is evidence that inequality leads to other social ills in societies today. The view of this does not require that equality is a "basic value" - more widely considered as bad as a consequence of unfairness. Usually part of a pluralistic framework. Therefore equality matters in addition to total welfare (and kind of in parallel).

**Deontic Egalitarianism** - if we are allocating benefits between individuals we ought to aim for equality (between the equally deserving). We do this not because we are aiming for a "better outcome" but because we are trying to act "justly and treat people as equals". This is non-consequentialist in spirit. It doesn't tell us how to rank outcomes but how to assess distributive actions as inherently right or wrong.

//Results/process oriented? I want friends etc to treat me well in a process-oriented way. I want the government to treat in a results-oriented way? Is this consistent?//

Deontically we do not care about inequalities that did not arise from the actions of individuals/institutions. Telically we doon't care how people become unequal.

## Problems of egalitarianism
Parfit 1991 - why should it matter where people live? We seem to think it does intuitively eg is it bad that there is historic inequality between us and the cave man. What if there is a far away planet - is it intrinsically bad if there is an inequality between us and them?

Unintuitive to think these can be compared. Seems to suggest that the Telic net is cast too wide. DO the people need to be related to each other in some morally important way? This idea is captured by the Deontic view though! Thie encapsulates the idea of a morally salient relationship.

Telically "levelling down" might be considered an issue - maybe there are scenarios where extra goods should be thrown away so that the existing distribution can stay "equal". At the very least this is "better in some respect" - though we need not define this without some stronger telic principle. Maybe this could be found exactly in specific circumstances through game theory type methods? Obviously not required though because welfare is still a concern telically. Again this does not trouble the deontic view.

Temkin thinks that The Slogan should be rejected 1993. Ie that one situation cannot be worse or better than another if there is no-one for whom it is worse or better. This kind of sums up the levelling down principle so this defends the Telic view from this objection if it holds.

Consider proportional justice (look into 138-140 Temkin 1993). Parfit does not think levelling down relies on the Slogan. He thinks levelling down is intuitively not useful.

Now a problem for the Deontic view - the Gust of Wind case. If a gust of wind unequally distributes resources - have we no responsibility to redistribute back to the fair state beforehand? On the Deontic view there seems to be no reason to redistribute - is this plausible? Makes it hard to be a Deontic egalitarian here... Maybe there is something wrong with inequality regardless of agent actions. But then we are thinking telically...

Maybe we need a plausible alternative to both/pure egalitarianism

## Prioritarianism
Benefits matter more when received by the worse off. Welfare within a life has diminshing marginal moral value - comparable to diminishing marginal utility. This also gives us some idea that losses are worse than gains which is consistent with other intuitions.

But is this just a measurement issue? What if the definition of welfare before takes into account this marginal effect? It tells you the greatest slope at a given point (giving a point of welfare to the person with the least) but does not necessarily allow you to choose between two scenarios.

This does avoid levelling down.

Lecturer claims that prioritarians do not attach any fundamental importance to how people fare in relation to each other. Instead it cares about the absolute terms for each person. This means we don't care in absolute terms but maybe we care when it comes to making trade-off decisions.

## Against Prioritarianism
Otsuka and Voorhoeve 2009: There is no morally relevant difference between the Single Person Case and the Two Person Case. Egalitarianly there would be a difference. Is this important? I don't think so - seems like the typical utilitarian obfuscation about people being equally important in the calculus.

Do we care about how friends treat other people or about how they treat us? Is the former used as a proxy for the latter? How rationally is this link considered?

## Sufficientarianism
What matters is that people have _enough_. There is some benchmark standard of living at which a life becomes acceptable morally speaking.

Positive thesis: it is of intrinsic moral importance for people to have enough

Negative thesis: after we have ensured that everyone has enough then it does not matter morally how things are distributed

Can we make the _Positive Thesis_ more precise? Frankfurt 1987. We want to maximise the incidence of sufficiency. But suggests that regressive transfers from the poorest to the poor (so that some members of the poor reach the threshold) are good. This seems counterintuitive! Therefore this doesn't seem like this is right way to capture the idea. Lets hope the _Negative Thesis_ provides a better alternative.

_Negative Thesis_ is typically supported by the intuition that we don't care about the distribution of goods between the very well-off. Who cares if Bill Gates has more than the Amazon guy? Similarly the upper middle class and the rich. Crips 2003 Beverly Hills Case

Or do we? Some inequalities between the rick seem problematic. Eg gender pay gap among highly paid movie stars and executives. Maybe what is worrying here is not the distribution but the discrimination. Can we explain what is wrong about discrimination without some appeal to the value of distributive equality? Segall 2012

I'm confused by this lecture lay-out - the same issue for the Positive Thesis seems to apply to the NEgative Thesis and it's a much stronger objection.
