# The Demandingness of Morality

Previously we looked at reasons why act-consequentialism was too permissive

Now we look at why act-consequentialism is too demanding. Ordinarily we are not always required to do as much as possible to promote the good.

Strictly this only is required from maximising act-consequentialism (not satisficing etc). Satisficing - Slote 1985 - an act is right only if it brings about an outcome that is _good enough_.

## Introduction
Suppose maximizing act-utilitarianism is true

Then it seems we ought to donate money and time to causes that help those living in severe poverty unless the cost to you in doing so would be greater than the benefit you can provide to others. Basically you would have to reduce yourself to a similar level of poverty in order to fulfil this. This is typically thought of as "supererogatory" - an act that is morally permissible and praiseworthy but not obligatory.

Maximising act-consequentialism eliminates supererogation.

How do we describe and explain the limits of moral requirements. How strong are these limits and how demaning is morality really?

## Varieties of the demandingess problem
Normally considering from an impartial perspective. This emphasis on impartiality may be considered to neglec the extent to which we are obligated to be partial to our nearest and dearest eg a child. We are setting this aside for this lecture - we are focusing on the objection that act-consequentialism introduces too many obligations (not too few).

Williams 1973 - the utilitarian agent undermines the individual's integrity - a utilitarian agent would not be able to formulate actions and decisions in a way that give meaning to an individual's life. Each project/action/decision is just another input to the utilitarian calculus - leaving the life devoid of meaning beyond utilitarianism. This describes the internalisation of the belief to the harm of the rest of one's personhood. This is alienation. Maybe this depends on the psychological effect of implementing the theory.

A reply - we should not assume that the correct moral theory is one we ought to internalise in this way. The correct criterion of rightness need not be the best decision-procedure. Ie we should act act-consequentially but we should not always consult the theory directly. This seems highly dubious.

A complaint that a theory is overly-demanding need not require alienation. We can complain that complying with the demands is too costly

## Agent-centred prerogatives
An agent-centred prerogative is a prerogative held by each person in light of which she is permitted not to miximise the good on certain occasions when doing so is permissible

Scheffler 1994 - each person should be allowed to assign greater weights to her own interests than to the interests of other people. Therefore the sacrifices that are required of each person are limited.

We could replace interests in the above paragraph with her own self-interest/wellbeing/welfare. Eg weight your own welfare at 100x the value of someone else's welfare

We could replace interests in the above with her ground projects and commitments. Eg life goals/serious obligations. Artist devoted to her art - the art completion is more important than any harm to the artist's wellbeing.

Scheffler proposes a justification for recognizing agent-centred prerogatives in terms of the independence of the personal point of view. It reads something like prospect theory combined with the ability to affect one's own objective function.

## Agent-sacrificing permissions
Scheffler's agent-centred prerogative permits us to fail to maximise the good if the sacrifice to use would be too great.

But there is no option to decline if the costs are too low. Common-sense morality also recognises the existence of agent-sacrificing permissions - Slote 1985. These are cases that we're permitted to not do what would be best even though doing so is costless.

Eg suppose you can only help or hinder your own interests. According to maximising act-consequentialism you act wrongly if you do not maximally promote your own interests.

Slote-1985 and Shiffrin-1991 - agent-centred prerogatives should be characterised as safeguarding the agent's moral autonomy or freedom. Therefore this provides us with an autonomous, morality-free zone where we can shape our own lives (that isn't tarnished by maximising act-utilitarianism that just tells us over and over again that we are wrong).

Kagan - 1989. No matter how plausible this sounds; this is all it is. The value of moral autonomy cannot be used to justify the existenc of extensive moral permissions. This isn't the regular idea of freedom - to be free in this sense is just to be free from moral obligation.

## Singer's Shallow Pond 1972
In these sorts of cases, how much does morality demand of us? Is there something special about the shallow pond case or does this just reveal how limited our beneficence is.

The intuition that the child should be saved is hard to reconcile with an increasing cost to rescue. Woollard

What is morally special about this case? Immediacy and sole ability to save?

Should we be prepared to make a similar sacrifice to save each of the 18000 children who die every day from poverty-related causes.

## Limiting the demands of beneficence?
Does geographical distance matter morally speaking? Could it matter in and of itself - ie it lessens our concern for the lives of others. Kamm 2007

Easy to see why it might matter from a psychological perspective but not clear why it might matter philosophically.

//The state should act in a utilitarian way towards the people inside it while the individual can act less strictly?//

In the Shallow Pond there is a single identifiable child that will die without your help. We do not have the same identifiability for the lack of charity. The difference between an identified life and a statistical life. //How does this factor into dangerous driving?//

Mine Collapse! So very costly to save the miners that the money could be used instead to save more statistical life. Many philosophers do not accept the conclusion that you should prefer identified over statistical lives. (not all philosophers accept this, and some think it is just from psychological bias).

Can we redescribe the shallow pond case? What if the pond is large with many children being swept about randomly. I think this introduces too many other psychological considerations to be useful

Murphy's Collective Principle of Beneficence 1993. If other people could do the same thing then maybe this affects the moral calculus. Is each person only required to do "their fair share"? Might explain the poverty vs pond dichotomy? You are burdened by being the only one.

If there are two children in the pond and two people observe it, then should each person only be required to save one child regardless of what the other potential saver does?

//Should we emphasis the value in saving statistical lives? YES. This is similar to results vs process -oriented thinking.
