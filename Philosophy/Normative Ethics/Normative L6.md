Kant's Ethics

MAny have felt that a key task for normative ethics is to find a unifying principle of right action. We need a plausible non-consequentialist theory

Kant believed reason could motivate action by itself. He was believed that autonomy was of huge importance - these issues will be ignored for now. We are just looking at his normative ethics though! Sources of Normativity - good place to read up on Kant

# The Categorical Imperative
K tries to establish "the supreme principle of morality". The definition bakes in some metaphysical assumptions. Rational beings must experience moral requirements as imperitival (commands that bind us and do so regardless of our individuality). Therefore this principle serves as a perfect theory of right action

Two key formulations

# Formula of Universal Law
"act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it becomes a universal law". A maxim is a "subjective principle of acting" - or the "practical rule ... in accordance with which the subject acts. It is the rule of conduct that you are following tacitly. A fully specified maxim is a principle to do A in circumstances C to bring about O.

The human will is governed in its operations by adherence to maxims - the self-chosen laws we use to guide our actions. The subjective principle that guide our actions may be unknown to us. 

The permissibility of an action depends on the maxim that is being followed. The criterion for a maxim is the FUL.

Sometimes not conceptually possible for every rational agent to act in accordance with an agent's maxim yielding a contradiction in conception - eg deciding not to repay money.

Sometimes not possible to will for every rational agent to follow the maxim (remember the willer must be a rational agent). Eg not rational to want people to never help each other. This is a contradiction in willing. This is not dependent on personal preferences - rationality is required.

If you act on a maxim that yields a contradiction in conception then you are violating a _perfect duty_. Breaking a contradiction in willing may be used to identify _imperfect duties_.

## Against the FUL
Yields some intuitively unacceptable prescriptions. False positives and false negatives.

Conventional act: depends on social practices governed by norms (eg promising).

Natural act: do not depend on social practices eg swinging your fist. These seem to lead to different amounts of universalisability

# Formula of Humanity
"So act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means"

But what is humanity and what is it to treat humanity as an end? Also remember that FUL and FH are the same law. Humanity denotes a capacity for rational agency. Rational nature is distinguished from the rest of nature by virtue of the fact that it sets itself an end. This principle is not speciesist - applies to some non-human animals sometimes.
