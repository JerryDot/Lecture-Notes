Contractualism

Broad church united by an understanding of moral obligations as the content to a contract that we would all agree under certain conditions. Hobbesian and Kantian - different in how they understand the agents' motivations

Hobbesian - accept moral norms that will maximally promote their own interests in some sense.

Kantian - view the contracting parties as motivated bya  desire for mutual recognition and respect. Inspired by FUL.

## Scanlon's theory

An act is wrong if prohibited by principles of a general regulation of behaviour that one might reasonably refject as a basis for informed, unforced general agreement.

This is designed to specify only one sub-class of moral obligations - those concerned with what we owe to each other. Not concerned with other obligations (like for example obligation to preserve natural wonders).

By itself this idea is not distinctively contractualist. If an action impermissibly wrongs someone you might think that that provides an excellent reason to reject any principle permitting it. Instead it is in his explanation proposed to link wrongness and justifiability.

The question of whether a principle could be rejected isn't to be settled by appealing to prior facts about right or wrong. The acceptability of a principle is always to be assess from the perspective of some individual or other. Individualist Restriction.

The question of reasonable rejection is _essentially comparative_ in nature. The _Greater Burden Principle_: a principle cannot reasonably be rejected by some individual if every alternative principle would impose much greater burdens on someone else. Scanlon does not provide a complete analysis of the contours of reasonableness.

Ultimately came from the question of moral motivation. (Why should I be moral? Why do we have compelling reason to act as morality requires?). Some answer by saying that we ought to act morally by definition. Others argue that acting morally is a form of enlightened self-interest.

Does the answer come if we ask "Why should we be loyal to our friends"?

Hieronymi 2011 - appears to be hijackable by other moral theories.

## Redundancy Objection

Pettit, Blackburn 1999: When an action should be rejected by a principle because of a property of the act, then it is the fact that the action has this property that _really_ makes it wrong.

Describes Scanlon's device as superfluous as that which is prohibited by principles no one could reasonably reject IS what it is for the action to be wrong. What happens when we apply Scanlon to some key moral questions?

Scanlon's approach does not directly address attitudes to animals. He also insists that humans with severe cognitive limitations should be accorded the same fundamental moral status as other human beings. Does not seem entirely plausible.

## Interpersonal aggregation
Scanlon's theory does not allow for this. We cannot combine the claims of different people given the individualist restriction. This contrasts to utilitarians.

Transmitter room, Drug Case etc

Does the drug case still exist if we weight the probabilities according to the number of people?
