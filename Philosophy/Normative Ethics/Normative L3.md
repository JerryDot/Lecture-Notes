We continue looking at elements of non-consequentialist moralities. Last week was DDA, this time it's DDE.

Doing harm seems to be more problematic that allowing harm. Compare Holocaust to Holodomor - is this principle relevant in that distinction?

# Intending vs Foreseeing Harm
Doctrine of Double Effect:

> There is normally a stronger reason against intending harm as an end or as a means than against foreseeing euivalent harm as a side-effect of one's actions, all else being equal.

Can consider as part of the ethics of war. Tactical bomber vs terror bomber. 

Tactical: Pilot bombs an enemy munitions plant. It is near a civilian area and so the explosion will kill a number of innocent people. The pilot knows this but since it may end the war prematurely, it might save more lives overall

Terror: Pilot bombs civilians, undermining popular support for the war (ending it earlier). Might save more lives overall.

Which one of these is regarded as worse? Even if the same number of lives is lost in each case.

Note the deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime. Coincidental civilian casualties are not. Geneva Convention. Is there some important moral distinction? DDE seems to underlie the ethics of war and the law of war as ordinarily derived here.

### The Trolley problem
Switch (Foot 1967); Footbridge (Thomson 1985)

In the switch case many believe that is acceptable to kill the one to save the 5. This reverses in the footbridge case :/.

DDE seems to be able to explain the difference in this case. In switch harm is merely foreseen. In footbridge, harm is intended.???
This gives DDE some initial plausibility


## Clarification
Sometimes find DDE formulated as a principle that allows harm to be brought about if 3 conditions are met:
* The harm is foreseen; not intended as an end or a mean
* The harm is outweighed by the greater good
* The harm is neessary for the greater good
Call this DDE-P. It can have counter-intuitive implications

Remember the Rescue II problem from last time. DDE-P allows you to run over the trapped person in order to get to save the 5. DDE as formulated at the start does not entail that it is permissible to kill the 1. This points out how ridiculously weak our formulation is. It states "there is a difference based on intent" without any discussion of degree or ability to deduce the consequences in specific cases.

According to Foot 1967, the plausibility of DDE is principally from its overlap with the DDA

Note:
* You can do harm that you do not intend
* You can intend harm that you merely allow. Compare Direction of Resources with Guinea Pig (Quinn 1989). What happens when this question is asked to terminally ill people who may benefit?

In Guinea pig it seems like we need to appeal to the special badness of intending harm (even including harm that we merely allow). (This is to allow our intuitive sense to be "correct").

## Alternative Intention Descriptions
But the DDE cases before may involve people who do intend harm. Must the terror bomber intend that civilians are harmed? Might the terror bomber simply intend that the civilians _seem dead for long enough to bring about an end to the war_? (Bennett 1995). It would not frustrate her plans if the civilians were found to have survived after the war ends. Nothing more is strictly necessary for her aims. Does the reasonable belief that they would die matter too much?  But this brings the position far closer to the tactical bomber.

There are many ways in which we can describe someone's intentions. In cases where someone brings about harm when trying to bring about the greater good, it is not clear that we must claim that the agent's intention is to do harm. If not then the DDE does not diagnose the intuitive problem. This problem is not specific to this issue.

_Cave explorers_ Foot 1997. Trapped cavers have to blow up a trapped person in order for them to survive. We might think that DDE applies here. But Foot argues that the cave explorers could merely intend that the cave explorer be blasted out of the way. If he survives the explosion then they would rejoice! They do not intend to harm the person - just to get them out of the way.

2 options:
* Insist that in these cases, the persons should be counted as intending harm after all.
* Reformulate the DDE to drop the requirement on intending harm.

### Closeness
According to Foot, the two events are too close for someone to intend the one (blasting the person out) without intending the other (killing the person).

What is the appropriate relationship between events that makes one event "too close" to another such that if you intend the one then you are counted as also intending the other.

Fitzpatrick 2006 proposes one thing constitutes another when the first thing _makes up_ or _realises_ the second. The placing of a full-stop _constitutes_ the ending of a sentence. The birth of my brother's child _constitutes_ my becoming an uncle.

This fixes the cave explorers problem. Does it fix the trolley problem? Might doubt that constitution can fix the closeness problem

## DDE-R
Quinn 1989 suggests we drop the focus on intending vs foreseeing harm; instead we should focus on:
* _Harmful direct agency_ - the agent deliberately involves the victim in a course of events in a way that foreseeably leades to her being harmed.
* _Harmful indirect agency_ - harm arises foreseeably but not as a result of the victim's deliberate involvement in the agent's plan

DDE-R: we normally have greater reasons not to engage in harmful direct agency than in harmful indirect agency, all else being equal.

The terror bomber must engage in harmful direct agency; tactical engages in harmful indirect agency.

//All these are just stories that apply to the moralities in people's heads? If we were born into a society that had the opposite opinion on the organ transplant case then would our moral intuition be different?//

Applies well to Footbridge vs Switch

But it may forfeit a plausible theoretical basis for the DDE. Nagel 1986. DDE-R drops the emphasis on intending evil to others - so maybe needs another explanation.

Quinn's proposed rationale draws on Kant's Formula of Humanity: Groundwork of the metaphysics of morals 4:429. The particularly problematic part of harmful direct agency is the manner in which it involves _using the victim as a means_. THe victim is treated as a resource to be used.

## Doing the right thing for the wrong reasons?
The agent may in principle have intended harm in the cases we considered the DDE as not condemning. Eg in switch if the operator wanted to kill the 1 person particularly etc.

Some philosophers believe in these cases that the permissibility of the action is unaffected (seemingly in conflict to DDE and DDE-R). Thomson 1991,1999 and Scanlon 2008. They insist that those who believe in the DDE do not properly account for the distinction between assessing someone's acts and someone's intentions.

Fitzpatrick (2003) - the permissibility of our actions turns on whether the action is _in principle compatible_ with having the right kind of intentions. (the individual's intentions don't matter). Therefore to reformulate DDE with this alteration.

## Back to the Trolley Problem
Most people have a non-consequentialist intuition of some kind. Should we trust these intutions? Act-consequentionalists may press the objection that these intuitions are incoherent.

Trolley Loop Case 1985 Thomson. DDE implies it is now impermissible. But this seems to be absurd. If so then the DDE does not explain the difference between the switch and footbridge cases.
