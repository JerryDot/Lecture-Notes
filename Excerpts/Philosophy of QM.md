# 2-slit experiment. 
High intensity election beam shows interference pattern like waves

Individual elections register like particles (with their distribution like that of the wave interference pattern)

## How do we describe this?

The Dirac Formalism and Hilbert Spaces!

Lots of maths and physics ensures

**But the Measurement problem!**

- when does the measurement collapse take place?
- what is the mathematical formalism trying to tell us about how the world works?

Ordinarily start with a theoretical picture of "the way the world is" and then develop:

Mathematical model
---> Experimental predictions
---> Test the predictions
---> Either support or falsify our theoretical picture 

Hence we can continue to refine the model

With QM we kind of cut off the "theoretical picture" - we just have the mathematical model. But we want a picture of the world that explains our mathematical model

----------------
Is reality at fault?
* "There is a state in the lba but it is not the aim of science to describe it"
* "Is there value in describing the state?"
* "Impossible to describe the state humanly"
* "There is no spoon"
* "Structural Realism"

Keep in mind "What is vs one's knowledge of what is"

-----------
"Are we the problem?" Wigner 1961

"Maybe everything happens" (many worlds)

"Do we need new physics?" eg by adding collapse in as a new physical process

------

## What kinds of interpretations are possible?
* Can we cut down the possibilities?
* We need to explain the collapse present in the Measurement problem 
* We also need to explain non-locality and its conflict with Lorentz invariance/simultaneity in SR

The latter undermines the idea that the state was predetermined at the splitting point.

Initial Reading:

* QM & Experience Chapter 1 Albert
* Feynmann lectures on Physics III Ch 1-3
* "Are we the problem?" Wigner 1961

Texts need critical challenge - there is bias in QM-interpretation - not scientific

examples of possible positions to take:
* Bell/Hidden-variable collapse
* Realists
* Many worlds
