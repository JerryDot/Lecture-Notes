# Behavioural Excerpt
This is basically just a list of some ideas about preferences and their impacts on choices in Behavioural Economics 

* Preference incompleteness
* Status Quo bias
* Loss aversion
* Risk aversion
* Can difference-break in some situations by +1p effects**

Concave utility curve means -> risk-averse

## Reference-dependent preferences

Think of a typical visual illusion where two shades of grey are actually the same - this is analogous to some of the ways in which we compare outcomes

_Prospect Theory Kahneman et al 1979_

* People deviating from full rationality/ expected utility theory in a predictable way
* Posited that outcomes are compared to a reference
* Then loss aversion, concavity over gains, convexity over losses and framing influencing perception of loss and gain all shown

Another idea is narrow-bracketing / mental accounting

Examples of possible reference points:
* Backwards eg recent outcome 
* Social eg peer's results/choices
* Forwards eg aspirations or goals
* Neural (determined jointly with information encoding to allocate scarce attention usefully (-> Camerer)
