# Doing vs Allowing Harm

Transplant case posed questions for consequential systems. Under act it seems to be ok; under rule it becomes iffy if knowledge of the incident would get out. "Most people have intuition that the doctor is not permitted to kill the one to save the 5". So it seems that the means matter in this situation? This is a point of contrast between common-sense morality and act-consequentialism.

"How you bring about the best possible outcome is important"

This can be considered in the form of deontological constraints. Intuition is fairly strong for these. But should we trust intuition? Do these intuitions form a coherent pattern? Are they mere squeamishniss? Do they reflect some underlying moral rule?

We will now consider two non-consequentialist principles

* The Doctrine of Doing and Allowing (DDA)
* THe Doctrine of Double Effect (DDE)

# DDA
There is normally a stronger reason against doing harm to someone than against allowing an equivalent harm to befall someone.

Trolley problem variant captures the idea of DDA. Intuition is that you cannot actively kill the one to save 5. At the very least it is harder than allowing one to die through inaction

Is the solution based on the person making the decision? They have to live with the consequences. Makes the issue about personal vs general concerns

DDA doesn't imply that it is always wrong to do harm; nor that it is always permissible to do harm. It merely says that there is a difference in degree.

Sometimes formulated as killing vs letting die. Features in medical ethics in the form of euthanasia, or ceasing life-prolonging treatments. It has led to the situation where it seems that passive euthanasia is acceptable but active euthanasia is not. "It is worse to kill someone than to allow them to die". Our formulation may not have this implication because we have defined it only in terms of harm.

Most moral principles in common-sense morality are defeasible rather than exceptionless. Eg if you promise something then this by itself gives you a "moral" reason to do what was promised. [This is undermined by considering an iterated trust game, or by relying on society to encourage trustworthiness]

### Rachels (1975)

Is there a moral difference between Rachels's scenarios. Maybe the difference is the effect of the situations on the perpetrator.

Maybe the intent of the agent can bridge the difference between doing vs allowing. Therefore this can be consistent with the trolley problem. (but we weaken our statement slightly).

## Analyzing the distinction
In our scenarios it is obvious what the consequences will be and it is easy to say whether someone does harm or allows harm. It is not always so clear-cut. Eg cases that involve withdrawing aid. (Kagan 1989)

Reneges on a decision to donate to charity - this means consequentially that someone dies from the lack of aid. Did Abdul kill the person or just allow to die? His intervention resulted in her death!

If we do not fully understand the distinction between doing and allowing then we may not know how much weight to place on it. Some suggest that once we understand we will see that the distinction has little moral significance. Bennett 1995 (The Act Itself). His analysis is very technical and involves jargon.

## Bennett
The distinction is determined by two factors:
* Whether the agent's behaviour has positive or negative relevance with respect to the outcome
* Whether the agent's behaviour has active or passive relevance with respect to the outcome

An agent makes something happen if they are _positive_ and _active_

A person's behaviour is _positively relevant_ to an outcome if the weakest fact about her behaviour that we need to explain the outcome is a positive fact.

A positive fact tells us what someone is doing as opposed to what they are doing. Bennett argues that positive facts are far more important to the world than negative facts. Consider the general behaviour space - a positive fact confines the space much more than the other. This makes it far more computable but does that make it useful/moral? Might make it "required" for a simple being though

A person's behaviour is _negatively relevant_ to an outcome if _____Fill IN_____.

Eg my behaviour will be positively relevant to some outcome if the outcome comes about only if I hold absolutely skill. Remaining absolutely motionless is a positive fact about my behaviour. This brings in the need for passive/active distinction.

### Active/passive

My behaviour is passive with respect to some outcome iff the outcome would have occurred even if I had exercised my agency in such a way as to make no difference to the run of events. Otherwise my behaviour is active with respect to the outcome

This explains why we consider the Explosion not brought about by the actor.

Bennett believes that the two distinctions are both without any moral significance. His conclusion was that no weight should be applied to the DDA (1995:140)

Bennett's analysis does not seem to be entirely successful. Consider how it deals with Abdul's aid case: it concludes that Abdul was active and negative by rescinding the check. Bennett accepts this conclusion. Uses it to extend the idea that there is no difference between killing and letting die. Many people still unhappy about this conclusion for aid-withdrawal.

## Withdrawing Aid
Can we say that removing a resource required for someone else is only allowing them to die?

No! Woolard 2015:57 - removing all of someone's oxygen kills them

McMahan 1993 "it matters whether we originally provided the resource that someone needs:
* Burning Building I
* Burning Building II

Aside: The word kills implicitly assumes a certain strength of causality and intentionality - maybe this causes a lot of the confusion?

Pipe Sealer - we don't want to consider this case of withdrawing aid to be considered "allowing people to die". As a result we are left with no clear distinction in withdrawing aid. This all shakes our confidence in the assumption that there is fundamental moral difference in DDA

## What Justifies the DDA?
We had to do a lot of work to maintain the DDA in the face of withdrawing aid etc. No clean divide that separates our behaviour - looks like a hodge-podge of situations and extra rules/considerations. Therefore it seems implausible. Now there is a strong pressure to explain why D vs A should have a different moral status.

Warren Quinn (1989) [francis cann and wood later]

Quinn builds on Foot's work: that negative rights normally have a priority over positive rights. Link to risk-aversion??? Negative right is a right against something being done to you. Postive right is a right to have something done to you. Does this just reformulate the same problem without changing the substance?

Quinn believes that if we can explain why "negative rights have priority", then we will have sketched a plausible basis for DDA. Quinn asks us to imagine a world where this is not the case

One idea is that negative rights are required to take priority in order ot recognise the separateness of persons. Without it then we would treat people as cells in a collective - more importantly we would require that each person internalise this belief upon themselves. A person can trade-off their own pleasures and harms but it is not obvious how this can extend to inter-person situations.
 
This can extend to link cases of withdrawing aid with more ordinary cases of allowing harm. They involve "exercising my right to control what's mine". Thus it does matter whether the aid was provided by the actor and whether the aid is operative and self-standing.
