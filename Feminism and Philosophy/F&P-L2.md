Handouts just have quotations on them

Last Week was Q of what is a woman etc. To be a woman is to have gone thorugh a certain process of gendered socialising that turns someone into a person. If you are a woman then it turns you into a person without full objecthood. Restricted by circumstances and personal character from making fully agential choices. In some respect not purely a subject but partly object. Budwhy's account of construction of gender

In particular there is a power in the severing of gender from sex - separate from biological fact. Not necessary from biology - is contingent that it places people in ahierachy

Will they continue to exist? Ought they?

Seems to elevate some parocial experiences as the universal condition of womanhood in general.

What is it like to be a woman in a non-white, non-upper class etc situation

Largely ignores other systems of oppression such as race and class. How do these issues complicate Beaudoirs dyadic pictures.

Race can be considering placing a white subject against black objects

Hierachy between good immigrant and bad/ able-bodied vs disabled

How do these hierachies interact and clash?

By making Men vs Women the primary clash Beauvoir isolates these issues

"Woman are complicit in their own oppression as it brings them happiness". Intuitively not true for all women. Eg lesbians in history who had to conform to society and a heterosexual marriage by neccesity

Consider women who have to work both at work and home. Especially working class

Coquettishnesss, sexual purity, feminity just as a badge of women's oppression from SDB

Last week's summary:
Beauvoir's account of feminism is insufficiently intersectional. Intersectionality has become a mainstream idea and issue.

Eg in Trudeau's defence after blackface. Did he demonstrate an understanding of intersectionality though?

When thinking abou tt he history important to distinguish between the concept of intersectionality and the word. Brought into being by Kimberly Penshaw in 1989. The idea predates the word however. She drew on an established tradition amongst feminists who had wanted to reveal the ways that white feminism excluded non-white perspectives.

She's beautiful when she's angry - documentary of some of the history

The history looks white; but that does not mean there was not significant actions being taken by non-white feminists radical or not. They may have been more likely to get involved in anti-racist groups instead. At the same time they fought for feminist justice as well as racist and class-based justice.

## 1974 
a black lesbian group ... River Collective formed in Boston (including Barbara Smith)

## 1977 
Black Feminist statement from collective - worth reading and still relevant today. Explained the history of the collective. Offended by the marginalisation on race and class issues by white feminists. Not enough to stitch together an anti-racist politics with a feminist politics with a queer-friendly stance. Class politics with its dyadic structure was also lacking. Wanted to combine the movements in some new and powerful way. Integrated politics/analysis/practice. Based on the premise that the racist/sexist etc systems are interlocking. Claim that it is continuous with the history of anti-racist activism/tradition. They had a shared awareness of how their sexual and racial identities combined to make their struggle *unique*. It is the outgrowth of decades of struggle etc. Crucial feminist gesture of personal experience to other groups. This focusing on our own oppression is... comes from our own identity rather than focusing to end someone else's oppressions.

First recorded use of term identity politics. They see the promise of emancipation for all as the natural extension. If black women were free then it would entail all people to be free. Would involve the dismantling all the systems of oppression from gender to sexual orientation etc.

Not always possible (in their opinion), but in this situation they thought so. Gained from being on the painful end of the white male historical oppression.

"There is a such a thing as racial-sexual oppression that is neither solely racist nor solely sexual". There is a history of white men raping black women etc especially under slavery. Cannot be thought of purely from race or from sex/gender. Was also a weapon against other men.

Need integrated analysis of interlocking oppressions.

Draw attention to the limits of some feminist theoreticians. Eg white feminists regarded men as the political opposition, going so far as to argue for lesbian separatism.

This was rejected by the Comboidsaf collective as they felt solidarity from black men. White women obviously do not need to with white men (unless it is solidarity in oppressing racial minorities). It is a dual movement - black men are both allies and opponents.

Therefore more complex integrated feminism required at theoretical and individual level

## 1989

Crenshaw gave name intersectional feminism - good TED talk!

It is a metaphor for talking about oppression. Some women stand at intersections. What happens at an intersection like with traffic is not additive. Combining two flows of traffic creates extra effects, from slowing down to crashes

Eg being black women is not just addition of the two kinds of oppression. Eg systemic rape of black women by white men

Intersection is more like union of racialised sexism and sexualised racism

General Motors fired black women first when layoffs. They were found ok. They were not being discriminated against as women, they were not being discriminated against racistly. **WUT**

This court decided that discrimination must be either or and therefore GM was fine. Particularly to do with the state of US Civil Law at that point.

Supreme Court looking at cases now to whether employment discrimination against gay and trans people is illegal. Will be considered as being on the same trajectory of Act 7

The law and also society ignored the oppressed in the GM case. You would have hoped that the theory would have protected them. Instead the law focuses on the situation of the most privilieged women and the most privilieged black people. This leaves black women as "too hard" to think about. Also white women and black men can become complicit in the treatment of black women via similar mechanisms.

World over domestic violence rates correlates with male unemployment.

Shedding light on domestic violence against black women will encourage the stereotype. This encourages the use of violent state power against black men. Don't want the issue of domestic violence to become a "black" issue. It is actually even worse in the Native American community. White feminists also not that interested in focusing on the experiences of black women.

The irony is that it is the most oppressed that are defended the least. Via an intersectional approach the aim is to raise everyone together. It must.

From an intersectional feminist perspective:

We should automatically believe black women when they accuse a white man of rape Should consider the racial politics of such accusations. White women have used false allegations as a weapon against black men.

We must question whether a racist police and prison system can ever be an adequate solution to the problems faced by black and brown women.

We might rethink radical feminist proposals to reject feminine ideals. These might mean something to a different oppressed class.

We might demand that women enter workplaces and have equal chance of rising up the professional ladder.

Nearly every working woman has experienced some kind of sexual harrassment. Not surprising that #metoo became a rallying cry. Just about every woman can relate to. Even then it is just a single strand of oppression in the workplace - pales into comparison to the differences between wealthy actors and their cleaners

Highly powerful as a method and a lens

Some feminists such as Naomi Zack see it as a threat. It fractures a unified subject of feminism into ever increasing numbers of subgroups. As more and more axes of oppression have been revealed this concern only becomes stronger. Does this lead to the conclusion that there is no such common woman's experience/perspective? If not then what is the point of "feminist politics" etc?

### Does a commitment to intersectionality lead to the conclusion that women have no common experience?

Doesn't follow from Crenshaw (paraphrased):

>Sometimes black women share similar experiences or oppression but often experience double discrimination etc. Insists that there is at least some commonality even if double discrimination is more common.

White feminism does distract from the experiences of the most oppressed people and so implicitly can never fix the entire problem.

Its origin was inherently self-interested. White middle-class women started the movement to fix their own problems. They marked out the vocabulary etc that can act to limit the progress for others.

That was the Lecturer's reading of the sources. They are considered as moderate intersectionals

### Radical theory of intersectionality

Here the claim is that there is no common form of women's oppression. Elizabeth Spelman - the inessential woman. 

Even if the extant theories do not show the full picture does not mean that no such full picture exists. Maybe there is such a thing as full womanhood. But the logic of intersectionality seems to lead to the idea that there is no such thing though.

Perhaps intersectionality reveals that there is no such thing as race, gender etc beyond a social construct. There is the irreducible complexity of social and political life. We use blunt analytical tools to categorise these interactions. Naomi Zac:

"race was always gendered and gender was always raced"

In this picture, the two are inseparable, with it all being irreducibly complex. There may not be anything of substance that all women have in common.

Is there a rival idea coming from trans community. What unites trans women and cis women? - are there two different ways to be a women?

Suppose there is some commonality between white women and black women. Black women on top experience racism. Does this render black women as an impure case of womenhood? White woman are left as "unoppressed in terms of race" - does that make them canonical in some sense? This is not a comfortable idea.

Do we want to split down to the level of incidents of oppression

What might intersectionality look like in a political movement.

Crisis in feminism where a lot of women don't want o be associated with feminism as they don't identify sufficiently with their image of women.

Butler:
>"efforts have been made to formulate coalitional ... unity as the outcome ... for political action"

^ afraid that coalitional approaches elevate the coalition builders rather than the people themselves. And in attempting to include all women, some women will invariably be excluded.

The contrast between a solidarity and welcoming environment and the rest of the world can be a shock. This incentivises keeping divisions.

"Coalition work is not done in your home, it is done in the streets ..."  -quote

This relieves the contradictions from the movement. The barred room (with people sharing your experiences) is not the world. Opening up the room leaves it no longer a home. It is not comfortable any more. This is a sign that things have gone right according to Reagan
